         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT Honourable, Sir Henrie Neuell Knight, Lord a Burgauene, and his ſinguler good Lord, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orſmuch, my ſinguler good Lord, as I haue perceiued you to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie inclined to the art of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and chiefelie to haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in that part, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie called Chirurgerie, I haue not beene a little carefull ſince my acquaintance with your Lordſhip, to further you in the ſame ſtudie, euen to the vttermoſt of my power, and foraſmuch as you haue ſo profited, not onelie in the Theorike part, but alſo in the practike, I haue thought all my paines &amp; labors well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. And although I ſhould holde my peace, and ſaie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heerein, yet a great number of poore men, and others, which haue bene cured of your Lordſhip, of many ſundrie griefes and diſeaſes, will ſet abroade and bewraie your notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and charitable deedes. And foraſmuch as your Honour hath better vnderſtanding in this worthie arte, than a greate manie of thoſe which take vpon them the name of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, I might verie well ſaie, the moſt parte. And foraſmuch as your Lordſhip beareth ſuch a ſinguler loue vnto the ſame arte, I am therefore moued to dedicate theſe my ſimple tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes vnto your Honour, to bee the patrone and defender thereof, for I doe perceiue, that now in our time no good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe can be gone about, but falſe detraction and enuie is like to ouerthrowe the ſame, which hath mooued mee for as
<pb facs="tcp:18258:3"/> much as you are a noble man, the rather to dedicate my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes vnto your Honour, to bee my aide and ſuccour in the defending of this my ſmall trauaile, which I proteſt I haue not taken in hand, neither for vaine glorie, neither yet for anie worldlie profit or gaine, for ſince the firſt time that I beganne to ſette out anie parte of this arte in our Engliſh tongue, I haue both ſuſteined great diſpleaſure, and alſo loſt manie profites, of thoſe which were in times paſt my ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friendes, and the greateſt matter that they haue to ſaie againſt mee, is onelie that I goe about to make euerie bodie cunning in the arte of medicine, with ſetting foorth of theſe my workes in the Engliſh tongue, but if it ſhall pleaſe your good Lordſhippe to vnderſtand my bounden dutie, firſt to almightie God, of whom I haue receiued the talent, and alſo my dutie to my naturall Countrie, whom I ought to profite with my talent, according to the ſaying of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, which ſaith, He that hideth his talent in the ground, and vſeth it not to the profit of his neighbour, it ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him againe. Wherefore my good Lord, I thinke it my dutie to ſet foorth theſe thinges for the commoditie of the common wealth of my Countrie. What greater profite may come vnto any in the time of neede, than to cure his grieuous woundes, without which hee ſhould preſentlie die: to cure his grieuous ſores, which dooth not onelie eate the fleſh, but fretteth and rotteth in ſunder the great bones, with moſt vehement griefe and paine, and alſo great inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tumours againſt Nature, which taketh awaie the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall actions of the bodie, and moleſteth it with moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and continuall paine, and alſo curing of broken bones, and bones beeing out of ioynt, to reſtore them into their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall places againe, with many other griefes appertaining to the ſame arte which were heere to long to bee recited.</p>
            <p>And for as much as manie haue taken vppon them the curation of theſe diſeaſes aboue ſayde, and haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many great errors for lacke of knowledge, to no ſmall daunger of Gods people, &amp; no leſſe hurt of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, I haue thought it therefore my bounden dutie, to ſet foorth my onelie one talent in furthering of knowledge, euen as the
<pb facs="tcp:18258:3"/> poore widow did, which had but onelie one farthing, and put the ſame into the Lords treaſure, &amp; like as that ſame was accepted with almightie God, ſo I truſt he wil accept this my good will, according to the knowledge which he hath giuen me, ſo that at the laſt daie, I truſt he ſhall not ſaie vnto mee, thou haſt hidde thy talent in the ground, and not profited therewith as thou ſhouldeſt haue done.</p>
            <p>And alſo I truſt that good men of my Countrie ſhal haue no cauſe to haue an euill opinion in mee, either through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or idleneſſe, for that they may well perceiue that theſe trauailes do both require ſtudie and time of ſetting foorth. Now my ſinguler good Lord, if they ſhall ſaie it is not good becauſe it is in the Engliſh tongue, then I muſt alleadge vnto them the famous men which were the chiefe ſetters forth of the ſame art, as Hippocrates and Galen amongſt the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whatſoeuer they might vnderſtand by foreine languages, either elſe gather by reaſon, or by experience, or obſeruation of time, all theſe, whatſoeuer they were, they did write them in Greeke, which was their owne language &amp; tongue, to that end, they might the better bee vnderſtanded, and ſooner bee learned. Alſo in like manner the worthie Arabians, as that noble king Auicen, Auerois, Albucaſis, Meſue, &amp; a great ſort more of worthie men, which did collect and tranſlate manie noble workes of Medicine out of the Greeke tongue, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue tongue, and many other languages, into their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall tongue, which was then the Arabian tongue. In lyke manner the Latiniſts were no leſſe diligent to collect and gather, both out of the Greeke and Arabian tongue, &amp; wrote it in their owne tongue, as you may reade in the workes of thoſe famous men, Plinius and Cornelius Celſus, with manie other more, whoſe workes are manifeſt at this preſent daie: If theſe worthie men haue beene moued with good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for knowledge ſake, and for the better maintenance of their common wealth, in ſetting foorth of this art for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, comfort, ſuccour, helpe, and health, of thoſe that be ſicke and diſeaſed, or other waies wounded or hurt, in warre, or by miſchaunce, &amp;c. Why ſhould not I then without blame or reproch, for the furtherance of knowledge and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:18258:4"/> things aboue rehearſed, ſet foorth in our Engliſh tongue, ſome part of this good and neceſſarie arte, for the inſtruction and further knowledge of thoſe young ſtudents, which are deſirous to learne the ſame, and to vſe the ſame to the profite of the common wealth in the time of neceſsitie, I doe not meane, that honeſt Artiſts, as Tailers, Shoomakers, Weauers, or anie other handie occupations, that they ſhould leaue their artes wherein they are perfect, and fal to this art of Medicine, for I doe wiſh with all my heart, that politike lawes might be made, to conſtraine euerie man to follow that art, in which he hath bene well inſtructed and brought vp in. But my meaning is, onelie to inſtruct thoſe that be brought vp in the art of Surgerie vnder ſome experimenters, who hath little learning in the tongues, &amp; yet deſirous to attaine knowledge, and foraſmuch as theſe experimenters are permitted by lawes to occupie the art of Surgerie, I thought it my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dutie, both for the furtheraunce of their knowledge, and alſo for the reliefe of theſe that be diſeaſed, to ſet foorth this in the Engliſh tongue which I haue done, I doo not goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to inſtruct thoſe which be great learned men, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the tongues, neither yet doe I goe about to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the minde of thoſe that be contentious and captious, that will rather finde fault with other mens dooings, than to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that be willing to learne with their good dooings. My intent is onelie to further thoſe that be willing to learne, which with humble and gentle heart doo accept and take in good part other mens great paine and trauailes, and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Prentiſes and young men, which haue not beene trained vp in ſchooles, neither yet can vnderſtand the Greeke or Latine tongue, and yet can vnderſtand and reade Engliſh verie well, and be of readie wit and good memorie, to carrie awaie that they reade &amp; heare: It hath mooued me therfore the rather to write theſe bookes in the Engliſh tongue, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the foundation of art doth conſiſt onelie in reaſon &amp; experience, neither can ther be anie third thing added ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, as Gale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirmeth in his 3. booke, named Therapeuticon, It ſemeth to me therefore, that he which vnderſtandeth any tongue, whether it be Greke, Latin, or Engliſh, it ſerueth him
<pb facs="tcp:18258:4"/> no more but for the further vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of that thing which he doth reade: for it doth not follow, that euery one which can ſpeake Greke, Latin, or Ebru, by and by to be a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, or perfectlie to vnderſtand the Arte of Medicine, for the common people amongſt the Gretians, ſpake the Greke tongue, and ſo in other countries, which ſpeaketh their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and yet neither Diuines, neither yet Phiſitions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth manifeſtly apeare by Galen, that the tongues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not an Artiſt, but reaſonable knowledge being ioyned with experience, maketh the Artiſt, ſo that in what tongue ſoeuer a man may gather knowledge, whether it be Greke, Ebru, Latin, Engliſh, or what other language ſoeuer it be, that ſame knowledge being ioyned with reaſon and experience, maketh a perfect Artiſt: yet my good Lord, I would wiſh that he that ſhould be a Chirurgion, ſhould vnderſtand the tongues, for as much as in times paſt they haue bene more diligent, &amp; careful to further their common welthes in thoſe countries, then they be in ours, by meanes whereof they haue brought many noble Artes into their owne tongues, which we haue not ſo largely ſet forth in our Engliſh tongue.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the profeſſors of Chirurgerie were learned in theſe tongues, they might more eaſely vnderſtand the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Arte, with their true diuiſions, and definitions which ſhould the more readier inſtruct them to follow a true methode, and this hath bene one cauſe which hath moued me to take this matter in hande. Thus moſt humbly beſeeching your Lordſhip to take theſe bookes, the fruites of my paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trauailes, into your noble protection, &amp; defend both them and me your poore ſuppliant, from the mallice of buſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters, and I ſhall not onely be the better incouraged to ſet forth other things according to my knowledge for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraunce of the common wealth, but alſo as my duetie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to pray vnto the almightie Lord, for your Lordſhips long life, perfect health, and dayly increaſe of honour.</p>

            <head>Thomas Gale Maiſter in Chirurgerie, vnto thoſe young men which are deſirous of knowledge, and are ſtudious in the Art of Chirurgerie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the name of the bleſſed <hi>Trinitie,</hi> I for the health of mankinde, haue with great paines and trauaile, collected and gathered together certaine parts of the Arte of Medicine, and haue put the ſame into ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry bookes, for that ende, they might be the better vnderſtanded, and for as much as there be many young men deſirous of knowledge in this Arte, and fewe of them learned in the Latine or Gréeke tongue. Therefore, I with the help of my friends, haue ſet foorth theſe bookes in Engliſh. This part which I haue ſet foorth, is commonly called Chirurgerie, for that it doth cure by the miniſtring of conuenient medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines with the hand. And for as much as diuers and ſundry perſons, taketh vpon them to vſe the ſame Arte, hauing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſkill in the principles or right vſe thereof, and ſome of the ſame doe dwell farre from Cities and good Townes, wherefore they cannot haue ſuch counſaile as is needefull to be had, when great and daungerous cures chaunceth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands.</p>
            <p>Therefore I haue ſet forth and publiſhed abroade, both for your better vnderſtanding, and alſo ſafegard of Gods people, theſe woorks, deſiring you moſt hartely to giue God the praiſe and thanks therefore, and as for my part, I haue done but my dutie, in furthering of the common welth in this my profeſſion and Arte, requiring you in the name of Almightie God, that when great &amp; daungerous cures hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth into your hands, not onely to be circumſpect to truſt in your owne doinges, but alſo to take counſaile of other auncient and graue men that haue had good experience, for in ſo doing, it ſhall not be onely a helpe vnto the Patient, but alſo vnto your owne ſelues, for in ſeeing of other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:18258:6"/> mens woorkes, you ſhall learne and ſée thoſe thinges, which you did neuer know nor ſée before: &amp; further more, the common people ſhal haue a good opinion in you, for that you diſdaine not to take counſaile of other expert men.</p>
            <p>Thus I leaue to trouble you any further, committing this my doing vnto your iudgement, deſiring you to take it in as good part as I offer it vnto you, and diligently to reade all theſe bookes often times ouer, and then I truſt you ſhal finde ſuch commoditie and profit thereby, as ſhall redound vnto your perpetuall good name and fame, and to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of many people, which other wayes through your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and lacke of knowledge, might vtterly periſh.</p>
            <p>Thus I beſech the eternall God to bleſſe vs all, &amp; to giue vs grace to honour and praiſe his holy name, and to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in this our vocation and Arte, truely, rightly, and without deceit, ſo that it may be to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, to the common welth, and your further knowledge: and finally, to the health and ſafegard of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord.</p>

And they haue brought to light what things were profitable to liuing creatures, by inuenting and exerciſing of diuerſe artes, as Medicine, Aſtronomie, Muſicke, and Arithmetike, and the worthie til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of the ground was inuented by them. Alſo <hi>Diodorus</hi> hath giuen this honour or victory vnto <hi>Mercurie,</hi> &amp; he doeth attribute the inuenting of Medicine vnto him. <hi>Oſiris</hi> the ſon of <hi>Saturnus,</hi> for his excellent wit, extolled him with greate honour, for the inuenting of ſo many noble arts, the which things <hi>Strabus</hi> doeth ſéeme plainelie to confirme in the laſt booke of his <hi>Geografie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where as he doth alſo write great commendations of the fruitfull ground of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for that it doth bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantlie all manner of things neceſſarie for the arte of medicine, which doth excell in ſuch plentifulneſſe, that no Countrie is to be compared vnto it. And he ſuppoſeth that <hi>Mercurius Trimegiſtus</hi> was the firſt that found out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, properties, and qualities of hearbs, fruits, trées, rootes, mettalls, ſtones, and many other things appertaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the arte of Medicine, he had diuerſe men appointed to be at his commandement, by the king of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Apis,</hi> which men did continuallie trauaile in ſéeking of hearbes and other things throughout all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and brought the ſaid things vnto <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and he made expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments and trials vppon them, and did wonderful greate things by their vertues &amp; properties, &amp; afterward deuiſed and inuented letters, and ioyned them ſo together, by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous arte, and taught them in ſuch ſorte, vnto his diſciples or ſchollers, that they dyd perfectlie vnderſtand
<pb facs="tcp:18258:9"/> them, and did write, and read their owne language, in ſuch a perfect ſort, that in ſhort time, throughout all the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, they ſent letters, one to an other, wherein one vnderſtoode an others mynde, then <hi>Mercurius,</hi> for as much as he ſawe ſuch vertue, in herbes and other things, as is aforeſaid, and how profitable they were, for mankinde, in helping of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, woundes, peſtilence, and many other things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, many people in that countrey were afflicted, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing compaſſion vpon them, and minding, to leaue a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall remembrance in writing, of the natures, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe herbes, and other things aforeſaide, and what diſeaſes they ſerued for. He called vpon the eternall Gods, to ſtrengthen, &amp; aſſiſt him in his enterpriſe, with wiſdome, and cunning, &amp; with length of time, that he might ſet forth theſe things, to their euerlaſting praiſe, &amp; to the vniuerſall profit, and commoditie of mankinde.</p>
            <p>And ſo he began to wryte, and wrote foure bookes, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of wood, as <hi>Strabus,</hi> doth affirme: and ſome ſaith, that thoſe tables indured to the time of <hi>Ptolome</hi> the great, who did dedicate them vnto the gods, and deliuered them vnto the Prieſtes of the Temple, where, afterwarde they were deſtroyed, by the meanes of warre.</p>
            <p>Some hold opinion, that <hi>Chiron Sentaurus,</hi> hearing of this excellent man <hi>Mercurie,</hi> went forth of <hi>Grecia,</hi> into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> to learne of him, and became excellent, in diuers artes, and ſpecially, in the arte of medicine, and in knowledge of the ſimples, and afterwards, he returned againe into <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> his owne countrie, and in that time, there reigned in <hi>Grecia,</hi> a noble Prince named <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was of excellent wiſedome, and diligent in ſtudie, to further the common welth of his countrie, with knowledge, and he hearing of this excellent man <hi>Chiron Sentaurus,</hi> ſent for him, and gaue him great rewards, and ſo he learned of <hi>Chiron Sentaurus,</hi> as ſome writers affirme, to know the natures of herbes, and other thinges, appertaining to the Arte of Medicine, &amp; hauing knowledge of them, and their natures, he put the ſame in vſe, to the great comfort, reliefe and helpe, of the diſeaſed and ſicke people, and to his owne immortall fame,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18258:9"/> for that he did help ſuch diſeaſes and ſickneſſes, which before that time coulde neuer be holpen, wherefore the people did honour him as a God, and ſuppoſed that he was a counſaile with the Gods, in that, that he did knowe the nature and propertie of theſe hearbes, and other thinges, which they did affirme, no man might know, except he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it of the Gods themſelues, and after the death of their king <hi>Apollo,</hi> they lamented and mourned throughout all the Countrie, thinking the art had bene vtterlie loſt, but hée béeing carefull for his Countrie, had taught the ſame vnto <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> his ſonne, which when the people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, and for the worthineſſe of his owne good déedes, they gathered great ſummes of money throughout all the lande of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and builded therewithall a rich Temple, and buried his bodie in a meruailous rich Sepulcher within the ſame, and called it the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and dyd honour him as a God, for his moſt vertuous life, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trauaile, as concerning the common wealth of his Countrie, and ſpeciallie for that hée dyd not diſdaine to cure the moſt miſerable diſeaſed people, which before his time periſhed without remedie.</p>
            <p>And now that wée are entered in amongeſt the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and for that ſome affirmeth <hi>Apollo</hi> to bée the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentour of Medicine, wée will procéede foorth to the noble men of that Countrie, which had this arte in ſo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, that they moſt diligentlie aboue all other artes, ſtudyed it, and in time dyd growe ſo excellent therein, that they excelled all other Nations in the world, as it doth moſt manifeſtlie appeare by their moſt worthie Bookes, lefte vnto their poſteritie, for a perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their moſt vertuous and painefull trauaile, which redoundeth vnto our greate commoditie, and to the helpe and ſuccour of thoſe that be diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>The moſt auncient of all the Grecians, I ſuppoſed to bée <hi>Apollo,</hi> who dyd cure many great and wonderfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, by the helpe of the forenamed <hi>Chiron Centaurus,</hi> and ſome ſuppoſe, for that, that the ſame <hi>Chiron</hi> dyd
<pb facs="tcp:18258:10"/> cure manie grieuous, malignant, and virulent vlcers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other diſeaſes, that the name of the Arte of <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> was firſt deriued from <hi>Chiron,</hi> for that hée dyd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter medicamentes with his hands, and ſo cured the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and being the firſt that practiſed with medicines by the vſe of the hande, it is ſuppoſed that hée gaue it that name.</p>
            <p>Then after <hi>Apollo</hi> came <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> his ſon, who was no leſſe diligent and ſtudious in the ſame arte than his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and calling vnto him diuerſe Philoſophers, and other noble men of his Countrie, and by their aduice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, hée dyd conſtitute, it an Arte, and made it lawfull for his ſubiectes that had ſtudied the ſame, and béeing brought vp with men of greate experience and practiſe, to vſe the ſame arte amongeſt his people, to the reſtoring of their health, in curing of their diſeaſes and infirmities. By meanes whereof <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> got vnto himſelfe immortall fame, and was called the ſonne of the Gods, and firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituter and founder of the arte of Medicine, as you maye reade in the Hiſtorie of <hi>Tragus, Homer,</hi> and manie more of the Gréeke writers, and the ſame <hi>Tragus</hi> doeth ſaie, that thoſe men which vſed the arte of Medicine, were named <hi>Iatroes,</hi> for that they dyd cure all manner of griefes, woundes, and ſores, and in our auncient Engliſh tongue they were called Léeches, and in the Latine tongue, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus,</hi> which names doeth ſignifie no other thing, but cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and healing of mennes bodies with conuenient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>Then next after were <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> two ſonnes, called <hi>Machaon</hi> and <hi>Podalirius,</hi> who béeing well inſtructed in the foreſayde arte by their Father <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> became wonderfull excellent, as it may appeare more at large in the Storie of the Troyan warres, by their cures which they dyd vppon the wounded, ſore, and ſicke men. Theſe two noble Princes, as <hi>Tragus</hi> ſayth, had manie Diſciples, which they taught this arte vnto, and they and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by continuall practiſe in proouing experiments, found
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18258:10"/> out manie meruailous remedies againſt poiſons of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane meates and drinkes, and againſt the poyſon of Hearbes, Serpents, and many other things, and againſt the poiſoning of Swoordes, Dartes, Arrowe heades, and Speares, as it is ſayd by <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Then of their Diſciples did growe a greate number, which were diſpearſed into diuerſe partes of the worlde, ſome were ſent for into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> &amp; ſome into <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſome to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and ſome to the <hi>Scithians,</hi> whereas they were had in great eſtimation with the Princes and noble men of thoſe Countries, for that they did cure and helpe their wounded and hurt Souldiers, in the time of warres, and alſo did reléeue and cure their people in the time of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and other grieuous infections, to the great ſafegard, helpe, and comfort of their people, and to the great ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſtaie of the Realme, which if their people had dyed of theſe contagious infections, that were ſaued by them, their Country ſhould haue lien open to haue ben taken and poſſeſſed of their enimies.</p>
            <p>Now of theſe men, vſing this arte in diuerſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, hauing many Diſciples, or as wée may tearme them Schollers, and diuerſe and ſundrie ſects and opinions did growe vp amongeſt them, by meanes whereof there was great controuerſie, contention, and diſputation of a long time, ſome ſuppoſe it was a leauen hundred yéeres, but the matter was not concluded indéede, till the time of <hi>Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> which after long and manie diſputations, confuted their fonde and erronious opinions, and brought this moſt excellent arte, vnto a moſt perfect waie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode of curing, which before his time was vnperfect, and vſed onelie by Experience, without anie methode. Some of the ſame Experimenters affirming, that they coulde cure onelie by dyet all manner of diſeaſes, and other ſome affirming, that by purging medicines they coulde doe the ſame, and other ſome were of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that with outward medicines onelie, theſe might bée
<pb facs="tcp:18258:11"/> done, vtterlie condemning the other two. Many other foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh opinions there were, which héere were too long to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. Now after all theſe commeth <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> that moſt excellent and noble Philoſopher, indued by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God with ſuch excellent wiſedome and knowledge in this moſt worthie arte, that his lyke was neuer before or ſince: hée eſtabliſhed this art and made it moſt perfect, that before his time was vnperfect. He wrote manie worthie Bookes of this arte, and ſpeciallie for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Wounds, Vlcers, Tumours againſt nature, Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Diſlocations, wherein hée ſhewed himſelfe not onelie to bée excellent in knowledge, but alſo in practiſe, as it may moſt manifeſtlie appeare by the Methode therein contained, he did diuide the arte of Medicine into diuerſe partes, that it might be the better learned and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, declaring which ought firſt to be learned, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ſo to the third and fourth, and ſo to the fifth, as it ſhall héereafter bée ſet foorth more at large. <hi>Soranus</hi> in the Preface of his booke, named <hi>Iſagogus,</hi> did ſaiy that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> dyd firſt finde out the arte of Medicine. And <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius</hi> dyd inlarge it and conſtitute it an Arte, but that noble man <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> dyd finiſh it, and make it perfect: He ſayth, that by the excellent knowledge of this arte, hée dyd driue awaie the plague out of all <hi>Grecia,</hi> and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a crowne of golde of greate value, by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée made in the Citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> for his great paines and good deſeruing toward the common wealth. After his death, the Grecians did make in a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Honourable déedes a moſt fayre Tombe, at <hi>Delfus,</hi> where they did moſt ſolempnlie burie his bodie, and wrote vppon his Tombe this Epitaph which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <q type="epitaph">
               <p>Hyppocrates of Theſalia, and by kinde of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Coos, doth lie buried in this place, begotten of the ſeede of the immortall God Phoebus, &amp; leauing in the world manie bookes of Medicine to put awaie ſickneſſe, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue health, what ſhall we neede to ſaie more of this worthie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18258:11"/> worthie man, there is no mannes cunning that may giue him his condigne praiſe.</p>
            </q>
            <p>After his tyme, there was manie in the Countrie of <hi>Grecia,</hi> which practiſed the Arte of Medicine, not onelye Kinges, but great learned Philoſophers, Princes, Dukes, and Lordes, and by their worthie déedes, in preſeruing of mennes liues, and putting away of ſickneſſe, they dyd obteine immortall fame, I ſaye ſuch fame, did indure long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and was more eſtemed, then the fame of theyr Kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: as for their names, I let paſſe, for that, there be many wryters, haue ſpoken of them at large, there was other diuers profeſſers of Medicine, before the tyme of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> that were of worthie fame, as you may reade more at large, in the firſt booke of <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> wherefore we lette them paſſe.</p>
            <p>After all theſe, came that worthie manne, <hi>Galen,</hi> who was without any compariſon, from the beginning of the worlde, vnto this daye, except <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> not onely for his excellent learning, in ſo many famous Artes, which he was perfect in, but ſpecially for this Arte of Medicine, which he was moſt excellently ſéene in, both in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orike, and Practike parte thereof, his worthie Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vppon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> doeth well declare his excellent knowledge, wherewith he hath moſt bountifully garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Arte of Medicine, as our latter writers doe ſaye, more like vnto a God, then a man.</p>
            <p>How excellent be theſe bookes which he hath written of the method of curing, called <hi>Methodus Medendi,</hi> ſome part whereof, wée haue with great trauaile, brought into the Engliſhe tongue, and likewiſe, other of his bookes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as hereafter followeth. Well, I will ſaye no more of him, but what ſéede ſo euer were ſowen abroad in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall worlde, be the excellent learned men, in the Arte of Medicine, not onely of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fountaine of all Medicine, as <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe doeth witneſſe, but the ſéedes of other menne, he hathe gathered together, ſowne in one plaine fielde, and watered them with ſuch diligence, that they haue ſo increaſed, that
<pb facs="tcp:18258:12"/> at this daye, the vniuerſall earth, hath receiued nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by them, perpetuall commoditie and pleaſure, and he for his great vertue and painefull trauaile, hath wonne vnto himſelfe immortall fame, which ſhall remaine to the worldes ende. After him came <hi>Aeſius,</hi> who hath written di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers worthie bookes, in the ſame arte of Medicine.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Oribaſius, Actuarius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Aegeneta,</hi> were worthie writers in the ſame Arte, as you may ſée by their workes, which they haue written, <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> alſo, which was before <hi>Galens</hi> time, I may not forget, for his paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trauaile, in knowledge of the ſimples, as it doth apeare by a worthie booke, which he hath made thereof. All theſe and many more, were worthie men amongſt the Grecians, and profeſſers of the arte of Medicine, and dyd alwaies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll and take <hi>Apollo,</hi> as the chiefe Captaine, and firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of the arte of Medicine: and <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> his ſonne, to be a ſetter forewarde of the ſame, and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> did make it perfect and finiſh it.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſaye, for the worthie <hi>Arabians,</hi> as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of <hi>Cartage,</hi> named <hi>Aunconius,</hi> Prince <hi>Auiſen, Auo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois, Auinſor, Raſis, Meſuea, Albucaſius,</hi> and many other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men, that ſpronge emongeſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who hath not a little garniſhed the Arte of Medicine, with a great number of moſt excellent bookes, which are to be ſéene at this daye.</p>
            <p>All theſe men, I ſaye, toke their beginning of <hi>Galen,</hi> and doeth honour him as their principall head, and doeth glory, and exalte them ſelues, in his name, for that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had perfect method of curing before his time, but cured onely by experience, as they were taught of their maiſters. For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> workes before <hi>Galens</hi> time, were ſo ſhort and obſcure, that they were vnto moſt men, not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by meanes whereof many doubtes did grow, but <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> by moſt worthie commentaries, made vppon the ſame bookes, made thoſe doubtes moſt plaine and euident, vnto all people, by meanes whereof, not onely many worthie <hi>Grecians,</hi> as I haue ſayde before, haue taken a courage to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18258:12"/> write, but alſo many of theſe moſte famous <hi>Arabians,</hi> haue followed their ſteppes, and examples, in ſetting foorth many excellent woorkes, in the ſame Arte of Medicine, not onely to the ſauegarde of their Prince, and people, but alſo to their immortall fame, and perpetuall and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting honour.</p>
            <p>The noble Latineſtes, haue alſo deſerued no leſſe fame, both in ſéeking out the knowledge of ſimples, and alſo in ſetting foorth of moſt worthie woorkes, in the Arte of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as theſe worthie men, <hi>Cornelius Celſus, Plinius,</hi> and before them <hi>Cato, Verro, Alexander,</hi> and many more, which were men of worthie fame, all theſe, as I haue ſaide bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, haue taken their originall and beginning, from <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo moſt apparant, that there are manie worthy men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue written in theſe latter dayes &amp; no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in our time, and of manie Countries, ſome dyd wryte in Fraunce, ſome in Spaine, ſome in Germanie, and ſome in our owne Countrie, and many of them were famous men, and menne of great and excellent knowledge, and practiſe.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Lamfranke,</hi> Archbiſhoppe of <hi>Millon, Guido,</hi> of the ſchole of <hi>Mompillor,</hi> and Commiſſarie to the Pope <hi>Roge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and <hi>Roulandus,</hi> of the ſchole of <hi>Mompilor,</hi> and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians vnto the King of Fraunce, <hi>Roſe Anglus, Gilbertus Anglus, Hugo Wiklefe, Anglus,</hi> of the ſchoole of <hi>Cambridge, Theodoricus,</hi> and <hi>Brunus,</hi> of the ſchoole of <hi>Bonane, Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus de villa noua,</hi> and <hi>Plaſentinus,</hi> of the ſchoole of <hi>Mompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior, Petrus de Argilat,</hi> and <hi>Gordonus:</hi> all theſe dyd write of the Arte of Medicine, about two or thrée hundred yeres ſince, and all theſe builded their foundation, and tooke their originall, of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and nowe in our tyme, there hath bene famous writers, as <hi>Iohannes Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, Antonius Muſe, Antonious Gallus, Nicolaus Maſſe, Iohannes Baptiſta Montanus, Iacobus Siluius, Alfonſius Ferrey, Hollerius, Leonardus Fuchius, Iohannes Tagaltius, Gabrielus Falopius, Rioldus Columnus, Antonius Calmiſius Vaſſalius, Ioh. Fernelius, Amatus Lucitanus, Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſcus Valleri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>olus,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:13"/> Ieronimus Cardanus, Matthiolus,</hi> and a great many more, of learned men, who we will paſſe ouer, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of tyme.</p>
            <p>All theſe which I haue ſpoken of, of what Countrie ſo euer they were, they tooke their originall and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, of our Father <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> although they haue founde out many thinges, appertaining to the Arte of Medicine, which we finde no mention made of, neither in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> nor in <hi>Galen,</hi> yet they had their foundation from them, and all theſe men, of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſo euer they were, they haue dronke of the water, that flowed out of their two welles, and doe greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce therein, and who that liſt to reade their workes, may perceiue the truth thereof.</p>
            <p>Now my friendes, to tell you the truth, in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what was the cauſe of theſe mennes writinges, I take it to be chiefely, to ſette forth the glory of God, in his wonderfull creatures and workes, as touching their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, qualities, and properties, which doth appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this artiſt, which doth vſe the Arte of Medicine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider vppon, for all maner of thinges, vnder Heauen, doe ſerue either for mannes nouriſhment, or elſe for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his bodie, or elſe for neceſſarie remedies in the time of ſickneſſe, or elſe for preſeruatiues, to kepe him from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to preſerue health. So carefull was the highe and mightie Lorde God, for his creature, man, that he made all theſe thinges, to ſerue his vſe, as neceſſarie helpes, in the time of his neceſſitie, and placed him in the place of ioye, with great ſolemnitie. But alas, his frayle nature, was the cauſe of his ſodaine ouerthrowe, from ioye to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, from pleaſure, to paine, from reſt and quietneſſe, to perpetuall labour and vnquietneſſe, from a moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Ayre, and pleaſant place, into a miſerable worlde, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with innumerable contrarie ayres, and chaunge of windes.</p>
            <p>Yea, I ſaye, euen from the place of health, into the worlde of ſickneſſe and miſerie: where our bodies be altered, and weakened, euerie daye, by mixing together,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18258:13"/> of contrary Elements, and we being ſubiect to the ſame, are dayly tormented, with innumerable diſeaſes. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Adam,</hi> at the firſt creation, was indued with moſt excellent wiſedome, and knowledge, by the power &amp; might, of the Lorde God, ſo that he dyd know all things, that were vpon the face of the earth, in the waters, and déepe partes thereof, not onely their qualities, and properties, but their ſubſtanciall formes, and figures, and gaue them names, as he himſelfe thought good, for he had perfect knowledge of all thinges, by the deuine ſpirit of God, which dyd worke in him, according to his firſt creation: but when he had ſinned againſt the Lord God, then was taken from him his diuine knowledge, and lefte here in this world, bare and naked, to take paines, and ſtudie for all thoſe things, that he would receiue commoditie of.</p>
            <p>Now man, as I ſayde before, being wrapped about with innumerable ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, and ſodaine chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which bée ſubiect to the arte of Medicine, which Arte, I call the arte of curing and healing, was conſtrained to ſéeke for remedies, in the tyme of his neceſſitie. And ſought out Herbes, Rootes, and manye other thinges, to helpe his diſeaſes, and griefe withall, and by vſe and longe time of practiſing, they dyd finde out the natures, and properties of many thinges, wherewithall, ſome tymes they dyd good, but by chaunce, for they obſerued, neither the natures of bodyes, nor their temperatures, nor the diſeaſe, neither yet the cauſes thereof, but onely regarded thoſe thinges which they dyd ſée and féele.</p>
            <p>Thus farre wyde was man, from that excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was geuen him in the beeginning, for in the beginning, he was not onely indued with moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but alſo with moſt excellent giftes of knowledge and wiſedome.</p>
            <p>All other creatures, beſides man, which hath not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the LORD GOD, but followed the nature of their firſt creation, all theſe wée ſée by experience, haue a certaine deuine nature in them, which man lacketh, for man dyd loſe it through ſinne, which theſe creatures haue
<pb facs="tcp:18258:14"/> not done, and for the proofe héereof, we will begin with the dog, which being ſicke, ſéeketh for a certaine graſſe, &amp; eateth thereof, and with the ſame cureth his griefe and diſeaſe: Onelie a diuine nature teacheth him this, without anie ſtudie. The Squirrell alſo prouideth her ſelfe nuts againſt Winter. The little Ant or Piſmere doth gather ſéeds into the ground, and biteth them in the end, after ſuch a cunning ſort, that they may not grow. The Storke alſo being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or anoyed with anie vncleane thing that ſhe hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, flyeth to the ſea, and giueth her ſelfe a cliſter with ſalt water, miniſtring it with her bill at her neather end, by meanes whereof ſhe purgeth and cleanſeth her ſelfe of her griefe and ſickneſſe. Thus may you perceiue the diuine and wonderfull workes of almightie God, working in his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures by a diuine nature, but man lacking this diuine knowledge, and lefte onelie to reaſon and Experience, is conſtrained by greate ſtudie to bring to paſſe thoſe thinges which by imperfection of Nature dooth lacke in him: By meanes wherof, all theſe moſt worthie men afore ſaid haue put in writing manie worthie Bookes of this arte, which arte they haue obtained by greate ſtudie and experience, and by a reaſonable method or waie, haue taught the ſame vnto others, not onelie to that end, that the glorie of God in his great and wonderfull workes, maye be the better knowen, as I haue ſayde before, but alſo for the common wealth of their owne Countries wherein they did dwell. The Princes and ſubiects being wounded, hurt, or diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by their greate and painefull trauaile, and by theyr greate ſtudie and moſt approued experiments might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored againe vnto their health, and the reſt which bée in good health, might bée defended from moſt cruell plagues and ſickneſſes, by the helpe of this moſt worthie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent arte. This art (I ſaie) is moſt worthie, for that it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vppon the bodie of man, which is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt creature of all the world: and as the ſubiect is excellent, which the artiſt dooth worke vpon, it muſt néeds followe, that the artiſt muſt be moſt worthie which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vppon ſo excellent a ſubiect.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:18258:14"/>
            <p>And furthermore, to prooue this art to bée moſt excellent, and moſt of all other to be had in honour and reuerence, I proue it by the ſaying of Saint <hi>Paule, That ſome men had the gift of wiſedome, ſome of propheſying, and ſome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>That theſe were done by the ſpirit of God,</hi> that is to ſaie, by the holie Ghoſt. Therefore <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> hauing the ſpirit of wiſedome and of the art of Medicine, moſt abundantlie poured into them, dyd excell all men before their times, and ſet forth this art ſo perfectlie and exactlie by the power and vertue of the ſame ſpirite, that all the vniuerſall worlde hath receiued ſuch commoditie by them, that their moſt excellent fame ſhall indure to the worlds end. All other men being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the ſame ſpirit, and with the examples of them, to ſet foorth ſuch knowledge as they are endued withall, for the helpe and maintenaunce of their common wealth, and for the reliefe and comfort of the diſeaſed ſubiectes, haue bene from time to time mooued with the ſpirite of God, to write manie volumes of bookes to their poſteritie, wherein they haue taught them the methodes of waies of curing, not onelie of grieuous wounds, great Apoſtumes, vlcers, fractured bones, and diſlocations, but of all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and diſeaſes, that chaunceth vnto the bodie of man, with their proper ſignes and tokens, to iudge them by their natures &amp; properties, their diſtemperatures, with their names and moſt exact diuiſions, to that end that they maye bée more rightlie vnderſtanded, iudged, and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie cured.</p>
            <p>Héere may a queſtion ariſe, what this arte of medicine is, and what you call him that vſeth the ſame, for many men ſuppoſe that he is properlie named a Phyſition, and other ſome ſuppoſeth that hée ſhoulde bée called a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, by meanes wherof in times paſt ther hath growen ſome contention as perteining to the Inſtruments proper vnto the ſaid arte of curing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſaie, the vſe of the hand, called <hi>Chirurgia,</hi> conuenient diet, named <hi>Dieta,</hi> and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of conuenient medicaments, named <hi>Phermacon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwere therof I haue told you my opinion before, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:15"/> in the beginning the Artiſt was called <hi>Iatros,</hi> amongſt the Grecians, and amongſt the Latiniſts, <hi>Medicus,</hi> and in our Countrie, in our auncient tongue, he was called a Léech: which thrée wordes, that is to ſaie, <hi>Iatros, Medicus,</hi> &amp; Léech, ſignified no other thing but to cure, that is, a curer of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſickneſſe, and ſores, wherewith mans bodie is grieued. Now, theſe diſeaſes cannot be cured without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, which inſtruments are firſt &amp; chieflie the hands of man, that doth make readie conuenient nouriſhment or medicines, and miniſtreth the ſame vnto the ſicke man, or elſe commaundeth the ſame to be miniſtred in conuenient order. The ſecond is diet, which is a ſpeciall inſtrument, as well for the curation of Wounds, Apoſtumes, Vlcerations and tumours againſt nature, as for all other diſeaſes which chaunceth vnto mans bodie: Both <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> doth preſcribe proper diet for wounds, according to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the bodie, according to the nature of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part, and according to the nature of the accidents that may be ioyned with the ſame wound.</p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Galen</hi> preſcribeth a diet for thoſe that hath vlcerations, not onelie in Cancers, but alſo in many other kinde of vlcers, which may neither be conuenientlie cured, neither yet preſerued in good ſtate, without conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diet, and as for tumors againſt nature, they require no leſſe helpe of diet than the reſidue: for it is a generall rule that we firſt take indication of the nature of the diſeaſe which we entend to cure, and of the effects of the ſame. As for example, in <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> which is an inflammation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered of bloud, for of nature <hi>Phlegmon</hi> is hot and moiſt, but his affect is to make inflammation, not onelie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part where it is aggregated, but by conſent and affinitie, which the grieued member hath with the reſt of the bodie, it doth often times moue a Feauer, which might grieue and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the bodie, and cauſe the inflammation to be more vehement in the grieued part. Therefore the Artiſt ought chiefelie to prouide for this miſchiefe, and there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waie to reſiſt the ſame, than by giuing of conuenient diet, which muſt be colde and drie, contrarie to the nature
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18258:15"/> of the diſeaſe which commeth of bloud, being hot and moiſt, for theſe be generall rules, taught both of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> that euerie diſeaſe with his affects, bée cured with his contrarie.</p>
            <p>Thus I thinke, there is no reaſonable man that will denie this inſtrument to appertaine chiefelie to the arte of <hi>Chirurgia,</hi> for reaſon doth approue and allowe it, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doeth finde it moſt neceſſarie and true: Therfore I muſt ſaie, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in his third booke <hi>Methodo Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi,</hi> All artes are grounded vpon reaſon and experience, neither is there anie third thing to be added therevnto: If anie man can ſhew me how we may cure vlcers, tumors, and other things appertaining to the art of Surgerie, by a third waie, and with other inſtruments than theſe worthie men haue found out by reaſon and experience, then I will giue place, and be glad to learne it, and if I finde the ſame to be more profitable &amp; commodious for the common wealth and for the grieued perſons, I wil not onelie endeuour my ſelfe to learne it, but alſo to followe it, extoll it, and teach it vnto other, but if no man can ſhew me anie other waie than reaſon ought to teach him, to ſuffer me to reſtore my ſicke Patient to health, by the permiſſion of God, with thoſe inſtrumentes that bée moſt neceſſarie and proper for mine Arte.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as concerning <hi>Pharmacon,</hi> which is called <hi>Medicamentum</hi> or Medicine, I thinke there be no men ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, no not ſo much as thoſe that be vtterlie vnlearned, but that they knowe that medicine is an inſtrument to helpe to cure diſeaſes and ſickneſſes withall, for who can cure a wound, a tumour againſt nature, or an vlcer, onelie with his handes without medicine, I thinke there is no man that is ſo ignorant or ſtupidious, that thinketh that to be true, then of neceſſitie it muſt followe, that theſe bée thrée inſtrumentes, and not thrée partes of medicine, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie men haue miſconſtrued both <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> both contrarie to reaſon and true experience, for the hands alone cannot cure without Medicine, neither can the medicines bée miniſtred without handes, neither yet can
<pb facs="tcp:18258:16"/> anie man take meat or drinke, except it be miniſtred with the hand, then of neceſſitie it muſt followe, that theſe thrée cannot bée diuided, foraſmuch as one is holpen by another, and the deſired health brought to an end by all theſe thrée, and not by anie one of theſe alone, as <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> dyd right well prooue, in confuting of certaine ſectes that were in his time, as <hi>Tragus</hi> dooth make mention by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that noble King <hi>Democrates,</hi> affirming that there were certaine ſectes, which then dyd vſe the arte of curing, ſome by inward medicine onelie, which they did purge the bodie withall, and ſome by dyet onelie, which they did vſe, as it ſéemed vnto them good, and ſome by mininſtring of outward medicines, to ſuch partes of the bodie as they thought good. And euerie one of theſe did affirme that they would reſtore mannes bodie to health, what diſeaſe ſo euer it were affected withall, if that the ſaide diſeaſe were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, onelie with one of theſe thrée wayes, and that the other two were ſuperfluous, and néede not to bée vſed. By meanes whereof there did growe greate contention, and great diſputation was had therein, and in concluſion they did ſéeme to confound all thrée partes, each of them thus confuting other.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> hearing of this great contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them, they all thrée profeſſing the curatiue parte of the Arte of Medicine, ſent for them, and appointed vnto them certaine men to cure, and aſked them in what ſpace they would cure the ſame perſons, and they appointed a certaine time, and <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> gaue them foure times ſo long ſpace: Then euerie one of them with great diligence according to his owne ſect and waie dyd miniſter. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Patients were not made whole, ſo that they were conſtrained to leaue them vncured, when they coulde doe no more. When <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſawe their doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, howe farre wide it was from a reaſonable methode, yet how ingenious and wittie they were in deuiſing and inuenting of medicines to bring their purpoſe to paſſe, hée did not a little meruaile.</p>
            <p>Then with curteous wordes he perſwaded them to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18258:16"/> leaue off their preciſeneſſe and ſeuere ſectes, and to vſe a generall methode, wherein all thoſe thrée were ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to vſe euerie one of theſe in his conuenient time and place, each one of them to helpe other, and then ther was no doubt but with their excellent inuentions, they would cure wonderfull griefes and diſeaſes, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could not bée brought to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe when <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> had made theſe thrée men friendes, hée required them to goe with him to their ſicke and grieued Patients, and ſayde vnto them: That with the ſame medicines which they had miniſtred before, by the permiſſion of the immortall Gods hée would make all their thrée Patients whole. So <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> miniſtring no other dyet, but ſuch a diet, as hée that miniſtred the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et had vſed before, neither yet anie other purging medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, than he that vſed to cure with purging medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had vſed before, nor yet anie other plaiſters or oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, than hée that vſed to cure with plaiſters and oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes had vſed before, euen with the ſame medicines that they did vſe, by vſing of them in conuenient time and place methodicallie, did cure all their ſicke Patients: By meanes whereof they were perſwaded to followe his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and to vſe theſe as common and generall inſtruments for the arte of curing, and all they to be exhibited and vſed with the hand.</p>
            <p>Thus it doeth appeare by <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> that none of theſe may be abſent from him that vſeth the arte of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> alſo as concerning purging medicaments, where hée intreateth of the ſame, ſayth, they bée verie profitable, yea, and alſo moſt neceſſarie in the curing of Cancers, olde, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, and rebellious vlcers, and alſo in Herpis, Heriſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And theſe purging medicines were chiefelie inuented and found out by experimentes, wherewithall they dyd purge and drawe awaye theſe vicious and euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which was the maintaining cauſe of all thoſe Vlcers and grieued partes, as it is afore ſayde,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:17"/> which other wayes could not haue béene cured: <hi>Galen</hi> alſo in his fourth booke <hi>De Methodo Medendi,</hi> by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> doeth ſaie thus, That Purgations of the bellie is profitable to manie vlcers, and alſo to woundes of the head, of the bellie, and of the ioyntes, and where there is daunger of corruption of the bones, or where ſtitching behooueth in woundes or where <hi>Eroſians</hi> be, or where Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, and other affectes bée, which hindereth the curation of Vlcers, and alſo where rollinges muſt bée vſed.</p>
            <p>By theſe wordes it is apparant truelie, that Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are profitable both to woundes and vlcers, at all times, when they bée greate and grieuous, I meane not onelie Purgations miniſtred by the vpper partes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Purgations miniſtred by the neather parts, as Cliſters, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Thus I doe conclude, that theſe thrée Inſtruments are moſt neceſſarie for thoſe men that ſhall cure hurts, griefes, and diſeaſes, and in no caſe maye bée ſeparated or taken from them: For lyke as the Carpenter &amp; ſhipwright muſt of neceſſitie vſe lyke inſtrumentes to finiſh and bring to paſſe their worke withall: euen ſo muſt the Artiſts in this arte, by what name ſo euer you will call them, haue and vſe conuenient Inſtrumentes to bring to paſſe the deſired health, which is the end of this art. If the Carpenter ſhould ſaie vnto the Shipwright, thou maiſt not vſe the Axe, the Saw, the pearcer, nor yet the hammer, for that they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtruments for my arte, then the ſhipwright might aunſwere him and ſaie, they be proper for my Arte alſo, and without thoſe inſtruments I cannot build my ſhippe, nor bring to paſſe the deſired end of my Arte. Euen in lyke manner it may be ſayde in the Arte of medicine, for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be called by the name of a Phiſition, or by the name of a Chirurgion, of by the name or a Léech, or by what other name you wil cal him, if ye wil admit him to cure wounds, Tumours againſt Nature, vlcers, or what diſeaſes ſo euer they be, it is neceſſarie that hée haue his proper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes apt and méete, to bring the ſame to paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. But if wée ſhall ſtand vppon the names of the Arte,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18258:17"/> and confound the inſtruments, then ſhal we ſéeme to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a vaine diſputation, and ſpend time about thoſe names, which are to ſmall purpoſe, for the name is not the thing that doth cure, but the arte, béeing methodicallie and rightlie miniſtred. For <hi>Galen</hi> in his third and fourth booke, <hi>De Methodo Medendi,</hi> doth name him <hi>Medicus,</hi> that dooth cure vlcers and woundes, therefore it ſéemeth to mée that <hi>Mtdicus</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgus</hi> bée indifferent names for thoſe that profeſſeth the arte of curing, and for anie thing that I can perceiue, either by the wordes of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> or by anie other notorious and famous writers that haue written in this arte: The Chirurgions ought not to bée forbidden neither the miniſtring of purgations, nor yet of dyet, for as much as they be their chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall inſtruments, without which they cannot bring to paſſe their deſired ſcope of health: And if we ſhall ſpeake of the antiquitie of names, I ſuppoſe the name of <hi>Chirurgia</hi> to be much more auncient than the name of Phiſicke, for I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Phiſicke to be deriued of <hi>Phiſilogia,</hi> which worde doth ſignifie, naturall knowledge of mannes bodie, and of all the partes and members of the ſame, &amp;c. And <hi>Chirurgia</hi> is deriued of <hi>Chiro,</hi> which is a hand, or as we might ſaie, a miniſtration of Medicamentes, done with the hand, vnto mannes bodie, onelie by experience. So that all thoſe that were before the time of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> were accounted but as experimenters, and to followe an arte without a right methode, which that noble man <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> perceiuing, dyd lyke a moſt famous Philoſopher, according to reaſon, ioyne together all theſe vnperfect ſects, which were in his dayes verie manie, and taught them one perfect and true waie, methodicallie to worke, and alſo certaine rules howe they ſhoulde learne the ſame arte, and diuided it into fiue ſpeciall partes, as we ſhall declare héereafter, which partes béeing perfectlie vnderſtanded, is the right waie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede to the curation of mannes bodie, and without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe fiue partes, no man can methodicallie and rightlie cure anie Vlcers, Woundes, Apoſtumes, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other diſeaſes, as wée haue ſayde before, for whoſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:18258:18"/> taketh vpon them, hauing not knowledge of theſe, he may be called a practiſer, and experimenter, or an emperike, as the moſt parte of our Chirurgions may be called, that bée not learned in theſe partes, and doth worke onelie by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience without reaſon, but thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnderſtand theſe partes, and followeth a methode in their curing, whether they doe cure Wounds, Tumours againſt nature, Apoſtumes, Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or what other thinges ſo euer it bée, that doeth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the arte of curing, that ſame Artiſt may be called <hi>Medicus, a Medendo,</hi> that is to ſaie, of curing, for ſo doeth <hi>Galen</hi> name him in his third and fourth booke <hi>De Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Medendi,</hi> according to the tranſlation of that learned man <hi>Linaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as ye ſhall the better credit the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this arte of Chirurgerie, as well for the antiquitie thereof, as for the Inſtruments appertaining to the Artiſt, I haue héere ſet forth before your eies an Epiſtle made by <hi>Franciſcus Valleriolus,</hi> in the commendations of the arte of Chirurgerie, which <hi>Valleriolus</hi> is one of the moſt notable learned men in the arte of medicine that is nowe liuing, whoſe wordes héereafter followeth.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, the profit and vtilitie thereof, doeth of it ſelfe manifeſtlie appeare, by the curations of greate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes, of wounds, of vlcers, of luxations, and of Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all the which this part of Medicine doeth intreate of exactlie. And of this part we will intreate in this Chapter, and of the ſame we will ſhew forth theſe things what that art is, and what be the parts of it, what is the end thereof, who be the authors, what the office and dutie of a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, what be his inſtruments which he hath accuſtomed to vſe in healing, what a one he ought for to be, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, who ought to be accounted the beſt Chirurgion, and thus we will finiſh our Chapter.</p>
               <p>Chirurgerie is defined of <hi>Galen</hi> to be a certaine order of curing, which is accompliſhed by accuſtomed inciſions and aduſtions, and other thinges which are done by the hande. Moreouer, the author of the Introductorie, whoſoeuer hée hath bene, hath defined the ſame after this manner (as they doe properlie call it) a taking awaie of things hurtfull, by inciſions and concinations, by a certaine methode &amp; reaſon: In like manner it is the curation of wounds and vlcers, which is adminiſtred to mans bodie. But if anie man will ſet forth the order of it more curiouſlie and expreſlie, he wil call it the third part of the methode <hi>Therapeutichon,</hi> which doth cure diſeaſes, by the artificialneſſe of the hand, by adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and inciſions, and by curing luxations, and by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting broken bones into their places, and ſuch like. <hi>Guido</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:18258:19"/> 
                  <hi>Caliacenſia</hi> hath ſo defined, that it maye be a ſcience, which may both teach the order and qualitie of operation, chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by adglutination and inciſions, and other operations of that kinde, which bée done by the vſe of the hand, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men to their health as much as is poſſible.</p>
               <p>Alſo, it behoueth vs to vſe this name of Science more largelie in this place, and applie it vnto that parte of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie which doth profit by meditation of preceptes and giuing of Methode, and not by curing with the hand. For it is manifeſt that Chirurgerie is an Arte, and not a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence properlie, whoſe end is the bringing to effect, and not the contemplation of the veritie onelie, and for that cauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would haue the ſame worthelie to be an arte, and alſo hath thought it good to place it amongeſt thoſe artes which do pertaine to the vſe of the hand: But other things being put in the definition, doe kéepe their place of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in like manner, this parte is not put vnaduiſedlie to the definition (that men be reſtored to their health) as much as is poſſible, for although that health is counted to a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, for a perpetual ſcope, yet that ſame cannot alwaies be obteined by arte, becauſe there be many diſeaſes vncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which doe chaunce, eyther becauſe they are ſuch by their owne nature, as <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> or elſe, that as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is taken in hand, doeth bring more diſcommoditie, and alſo a more grieuous ſickneſſe than that which is taken in hand to be cured. As when we goe about to cure <hi>Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginem, Antiquam, Lichenas, Hemorroidas, Sinuoſa vlcera,</hi> and the old <hi>Fiſtulas,,</hi> Cancers, and to conclude, when as we haue a ſtubburne patient which doth giue no regard to the Surgions that gouerneth him: theſe are the cauſes why that all cannot be brought to their health by arte: In like manner Chirurgerie is diuided into two partes general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the one is, which doth declare what things belong to the art, &amp; doth ſet forth the precepts, wherwith the workman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed, may worke rightly: This part the Gréeks do call <hi>Theoreticon,</hi> &amp; we do cal it <hi>Theorica,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſaie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or ſpeculatiue part, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other doth folow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, &amp; doth perform in effect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> precepts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former, &amp; it is called in Gréek <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:18258:19"/> or rather <hi>Poetica,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, a bringer of things to paſſe, for it wholy doth conſiſt in doing and bringing to effect, and ſéeing that the whole Arte, doth depend of theſe, we maye with good cauſe, thinke Chirurgerie worthie to be called an arte, as whoſe ende, is affection and woork. For ſhe doth exerciſe all her properties, either in ſoft me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, or in harde parts. The ſoft parts are thoſe, which haue their beginning of bloud, and are called fleſhie, and the hard parts do ſpring of ſéede. And chirurgerie doth exerciſe her facultie in thoſe partes by inciſion, by cutting, or by taking away, by repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and aduſtion. And truely of this arte, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other more ſpeciall partes, as thoſe about the which the arte it ſelfe is ſpeciallye occupied, that is to ſaye, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors againſt nature, wounds, vlcers, fractures, and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acions. Therefore as there be fiue parts which the art doth intreate of, ſo there be fiue partes of Chirurgerie, in the whole, as which doe teache vs to cure tumours, which woundes, and which vlcers, and which can put fractures and luxacions, in their proper place. But the ende where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto Chirurgerie directed all his actions, and prouiſions, is the ablation, and taking away of thoſe ſickneſſes, which maye be cured by miniſtracion of conuenient medicines with the hande, &amp; to reſtore the ſicke, vnto his health, which ende truely the workeman cannot alwayes obtaine vnto. For thoſe cauſes which we declared before, ſéeing that it is not in his power, to cure euery ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>And this long arte, vaunteth hir ſelfe, vnto the famous companie of excellent and noble authors, worthie of great renowne. In whoſe regiſter, that diuine man <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the patron and defender of the noble arte of Medicine, doth of very right, challenge to him ſelfe, the chiefeſt place, by whoſe meane this parte of medicine, is better declared, then it was before his time, the which thing, the deuine monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he left to his poſteritie, doe witneſſe, I doe meane his bookes, wherein he doth ſpeake, of the woundes of the head, of fractures of the lyms, of vlcers, of fiſtules, of the emorodes, and of the furniture of Chirurgerie, and of cutting out of the Anathomies.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:20"/>
               <p>Furthermore, Chirurgerie béeinge as it were deuided at length from the other, hath choſen vnto hir ſelfe a proper place, and beganne to haue hir proper profeſſors, for in the time of olde writers, &amp; in the floriſhing age of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> Chirurgia was not deuided from the other parts of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, for they were then both Phiſitions and Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> declareth it to haue floriſhed in <hi>Egipt,</hi> which hath ſet foorth and garniſhed this Arte in many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes. And after him <hi>Gorgias Soſtratus, Hieron,</hi> and the two <hi>Apollonij, Amomus, Alexandrinus,</hi> and many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men, and it is certaine, that there was no meane profeſſors of the ſame arte, at <hi>Rome,</hi> as the auncient. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Tryphon, Euelpiſtus,</hi> and <hi>Meges,</hi> the moſt excellent of all, as <hi>Celſus</hi> writeth. But how much <hi>Galen</hi> excelled, in reſtoring, and enriching this parte of medicine, his learned Commentaries, vpon the bookes of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> wherein he doth declare of the Arte of Medicine, and vpon his booke <hi>De articulis &amp; de fracturis.</hi> And moreouer, his ſixe bookes, of the firſt methode of curing, called <hi>Therapeuticon,</hi> and the laſt two of the ſame, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two alſo, <hi>De arte curatiua ad Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conem,</hi> his booke, <hi>De tumoribus preter naturam,</hi> &amp; his booke <hi>De compoſitione medicamentorum, ſecundum genera,</hi> doe teſtifie abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly. Moreouer, <hi>Paulus oegeneta,</hi> ought greatly to be commended, who in a method compendious, but yet moſt exact, hath comprehended all Chirurgerie, both in his fourth booke, and alſo in his ſixt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Auicenna, Raſius, Albucaſis,</hi> and <hi>Haliabbas,</hi> being of the ſchoole of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> haue intreated moſt diligently, of the Arte of Chirurgerie, as <hi>Auicenna,</hi> in his fourth Canon, and the third, fourth, and fifte féen.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Raſus,</hi> in his ſeuenth booke, to <hi>Almanſer,</hi> the King, <hi>Albucaſis,</hi> in a whole volume, <hi>Haliabbas,</hi> in his ninth booke, of practiſe of the regall diſpoſition, neither hath ſhe lacked hir honour, of Latines, <hi>Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Plinius,</hi> Captaines, who with great beautie, and like dignitie, haue intreated brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this parte. Why ſhould I paſſe ouer <hi>Guydo de Gauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aco,</hi> who onely among the French, we haue knowne to haue intreated very well of Chirurgerie, if ye regard the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18258:20"/> reaſon of the arte? We may trulie gather by his rude ſpéech that he wanted onelie ſuch happie time wherein he coulde not come to the knowledge of the Gréeke tongue, nor to the pure eloquence of the Latine tongue, whileſt at that time ignorance and barbarouſneſſe exerciſed tyrannie ouer good learning, which was the cauſe that in rehearſing the place of <hi>Galen,</hi> the truth of the author was much deſired: But if God graunt me life, I will diuide thoſe places of the Arte of Medicine, from the common place, I truſt that I ſhall helpe <hi>Guido,</hi> and I will of a barbarous and impure writer, make him a fine and eloquent Latiniſt, &amp; reſtore him to his beutie, &amp; which our frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Siluius</hi> hath performed in correcti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>Meſueus,</hi> the ſame doe I faithfullie promiſe to the ſtudious, to multiplie in repairing of <hi>Guido,</hi> if God proſper our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, although perhaps without méete or equal thanks, yet ſhall I doe it with due labour and good will. But now I will returne to my purpoſe, for manie famous men, and authors moſt worthie of fauourable commendations, haue ſet forth this arte, among the which, <hi>Guido, Vigonius,</hi> and among the men of this age, <hi>Tagaltius</hi> being my fellowe in office, and my companion in my ſtudies, haue done greate things and worthie of praiſe, in amplifying and garniſhing this part, whereby it may be gathered, how much is vnto this art to be attributed, which ſo many renowmed, haue each one in his workes and monuments ſet forth, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and enriched, that men might know it to be moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in effects moſt euident among all the partes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
               <p>Now muſt we ſhow what are the duties and office of a Chirurgion, and howe he ſhould enterpriſe the ſame, for there be thrée chiefe points which pertaineth to a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, wherein all the whole reaſon of the arte ſéemeth to conſiſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt doth conſiſt in looſing and ſeparating that which is conioyned. The ſecond is, in ioyning and bringing that to a good vnition, which is diuided. The third is in remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and taking away by inciſion, or otherwiſe, that which is ſuperfluous. Moreouer, the Chirurgion diuideth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:21"/> either by inciſion, by cutting off, by letting of bloud, or by ſcarification: That which is diuided, he conioyneth by adglutination of wounds, and by reſtoring, of diſplaced bones into their place againe, and alſo by curing of Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that is to ſay, broken bones. And he cutteth away ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous mattier by taking awaie tumors againſt nature, &amp; that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſtration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand, as in extirpation diuers waies of <hi>Ganglia, Carcinonata,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Cancer, Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Nodus, Strumas,</hi> &amp; other of that kind, either elſe in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water out of the bellie in Hidrops, or elſe in cutting off a ſuperfluous finger, when as there be ſixe or more vpon the hand, or elſe by taking awaie of Cataracts, which the Gréekes call <hi>Ptirigion,</hi> or the web in the eies. For truelie theſe be the chiefe duties of a Chirurgion, and the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ought moſt truſtelie to execute.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that is, when he hath performed all theſe things, ſafelie, readilie, and quicklie, &amp; with as little griefe as may be, and alſo without all fraude and deceit, <hi>Galen</hi> eſtéemeth to be the dutie of a Phiſition that cureth rightlie, and that onelie regardeth the vtilitie of the ſicke: For theſe be things which cannot otherwiſe be done by the arte of Medicine, &amp; therefore they be moſt profitable in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, and the artes thereof were had in moſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the olde time, as the auncient writers doe declare. Therfore ſo profit thou, ſaith <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> in diſeaſes, that thou hurt them not. This ſcope muſt therefore alwayes be had in thoſe things, that the Chirurgion will endeuour to doe, that he profit the ſicke, and take in hand the curation of diſeaſes with good faith and honeſt, and with a beneficiall will towards his neighbour, and whatſoeuer he knoweth himſelfe able to cure by the benefit of his arte, that let him enterpriſe to doe with all diligence, but inuinſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſes, ſuch are <hi>Oculti carni, Elephantiaſis,</hi> and old Callous, hollow and fraudulent vlcers, let him not once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to meddle with, leaſt he get the name of an euyll Surgion.</p>
               <p>And further, becauſe that we haue ſaid, that a Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt ſafelie cure, there be thrée thinges worthie to bée
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18258:21"/> noted, which <hi>Galen</hi> doth mencion in his xiiii. booke, <hi>De me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodo medendi,</hi> vnto all the which the diligent Chirurgion, ſhal ſafely haue regard. The firſt is, that he diligently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the perfection of his worke, which he doth enterpriſe, for the reſtoring the ſick perſon to his health. The ſecond is, if he may not obtein this ſcope, that at leaſt he hurt not, the ſicke perſon through his woorke: for that is the precept of <hi>Hippocrates, lib. i. Epid. textu.</hi> 50. ſaying, <hi>Profit thou ſo in ſickneſſe, that thou hurt not.</hi> The third and laſt is, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough diligent care, the diſeaſe do not eaſely returne again, for the ſtudie of the Chirurgion is, that he by operation, may remoue all the diſeaſes and griefes which are in mans bodie, contrarie to nature: But if he cannot bring this thing to paſſe, then let him take his chiefe counſail of that learned ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Galen,</hi> how he ſhould remoue theſe hurts. Moreouer, the cunning artiſt ſhall practiſe all things proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly, if he will ſtudie to cure diſeaſes, by their indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is a wittie beginning of things to be done, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth in his xiiii. booke, <hi>De methodo medendi,</hi> and the firſt indication, is the conſeruation of thoſe thinges which are in mans body, according to nature, and the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thoſe which are againſt nature.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, thoſe thinges which be in mans bodie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, are kept by the like vſe of their lyke, &amp; thoſe which be againſt nature, are driuen foorth by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and that if the diſeaſe doe néede ſuch méete curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, it is moſt certaine, that there are ſome diſeaſes, which cannot be expelled out of the bodie.</p>
               <p>And we doe know them by this, when as the effect it ſelfe, of his owne nature, and whole aſſencie, doth refuſe all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of curing, as the diſeaſe <hi>Elefantiaſis abſoluta,</hi> &amp; as men commonly call it <hi>confirmata,</hi> or elſe when the patient (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the diſeaſe be otherwiſe curable) ſhall continue ſuch helpes, as are to the curation neceſſarie, namely cutting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as in <hi>Spaſelus,</hi> or elſe aduſtion or inciſion, where they ſhalbe néedefull: and the diſeaſes of ſicke men, are made for the moſt part vncurable, either by the tenderneſſe of the patient, or yelding to the diſeaſe.</p>

Furthermore, he muſt haue a ſure and ſtrong hand, and ſteadfaſt to all workes that hée ſhall doe, whether it be to make inciſion, aduſtion, &amp; alſo for the cutting awaie of a member. Alſo it behooueth him to haue a quicke and cléere eie, and he muſt not be fearefull of mind, but rather without pittie, if he do intend to cure him that he taketh in hand. Furthermore, neither let him make the more haſt, neither let him cut Canteries, or cut off leſſe than néede requireth, for the clamor or crying out, or for the tenderneſſe of the ſicke Patient, but let him doe all things as though he heard not the clamors of the ſicke, neither let his minde be therwith anie thing troubled: And wée haue declared that a Chyrurgion ought to excell in learning, for therein chiefelie doth his erudition manifeſtly appeare, if he vnderſtand exactlie both the Theorike and the Practike parts, that is to ſaie, to know things naturall and not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and alſo thoſe that are againſt nature.

But foraſmuch as ſome men doe more regard the authorities of authors, than they doe the true iudgement of reaſon and experience, which two are the foundation of all Artes, and wil alleadge and ſaie, this is but his owne inuention, wherfore I wil not beléeue him, though it appeare neuer ſo much to be reaſonable, ſhal I credit one or two mens ſayings, that the art of Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie is ſo auncient, or that the inſtruments appertaining to the ſame art, is diet and medicaments, no I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue it, for thoſe inſtrumentes doe pertaine onelie to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, and not to Chirurgerie, for the inſtrumentes of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie be onelie outward medicines, as Plaiſters, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, oiles, pouders, &amp;c. with a great many of yron inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Then I ſaie, either we muſt breake <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> precepts, and by that meanes grow into ignorance againe, either elſe we muſt follow the true and right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, ſet out by him, wherein he did vſe all theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments generallie and indifferentlie, as time and cauſe dyd require.</p>
               <p>And alſo <hi>Galen,</hi> as it may more at large appeare in his fourth booke <hi>De Methodo Medendi,</hi> &amp; in his bookes of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicaments, where he doth confute diuerſe Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which woulde not admit purging medicines in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſeaſes, as <hi>Aſclapiades, &amp;c.</hi> Saying, <hi>That purging medicaments are neceſſarie to be vſed, where there be great and daungerous wounds, and where there be great accidents that chanceth vnto the ſame, to purge &amp; draw awaie the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous quantitie of thoſe humours, which might hurt the grieued part, or hinder the curation thereof,</hi> as he doth declare in the ſame booke <hi>De Methodo Medendi.</hi> And he ſaith in his bookes of purging medicamentes, <hi>That purgations are needfull for the curation of Cancers, Herpis, Eriſipulas, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalus, Gangrena, and many other outward griefes which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vnto mans bodie.</hi> And he doth affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without theſe things, he could not haue brought to health his diſeaſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.

               <p>TO the exact knowledge of the arte or ſcience, which is called Chyrurgerie, it behooueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Artiſt to know foure things. Firſt, what Chyrurgerie is, what is the matter ſubiect to Chirurgerie, what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18258:25"/> Chirurgerie, and alſo what order is to be obſerued &amp; kept in the learning of Chirurgerie. And we doe knowe what Chirurgerie is by thrée manner of waies. Firſt, by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timologie of the word or name, by his definition, and by his diuiſion: Chirurgerie after his Etimologie, is called the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the hand, for it is named <hi>Apo tes chiros, cai tou ergou,</hi> that is to ſaie, of the hande, and his worke, becauſe this Arte is exerciſed by the adminiſtration with the hand, and héereof commeth it to paſſe, that the miniſter with the hand is called <hi>Chirurgus,</hi> that is to ſaie, a Chirurgion: Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie according to the aſſentiall definition, is an Arte, which by the adminiſtration of the hand, doth expell &amp; driue awaie ſickneſſe out of mans bodie, whereof chieflie &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie it taketh cure and charge, or elſe Chirurgerie is an art, which by the cunning working with the hand, doth put awaie or remoue the ſickneſſes or diſeaſes of mans bodie. The matter ſubiect to the art of Chirurgery, &amp; the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which the Artiſt doth occupie himſelfe about, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mans bodie, ſubiect to diſeaſes &amp; infirmities, which diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and infirmities requireth the help of medicaments, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by the hand: For all things that the art of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie doth finde out either by reaſon or experience, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame to be done by the adminiſtration of the hand, to the vtilitie &amp; profit of mannes bodie. Furthermore, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie is diuided into two parts, that is to ſaie, into The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orike and Practike. The Theorike part doth teach, and is a ſcience obteined by demonſtration, &amp; by knowing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the art. This part a man may haue, although hée neuer exerciſe or practiſe anie parte of the ſame, as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phiſitions and other learned men which dailie readeth the principles of Chirurgerie: But the Practike parte of Chirurgerie, is an arte which doth rightlie and readilie, by the adminiſtration of the hand vſe ſuch things as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt mechanical arts, which part no man can be perfect in, except he be brought vp and exerciſed in the ſame. And doth both continuallie ſée other expert men worke in the ſame arte, &amp; diligentlie obſerue ſuch things as he dooth ſée wrought.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:26"/>
               <p>Now theſe two partes are commonlie exerciſed about theſe griefes, with their accidents, that is to ſaie, tumors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, gréene wounds, vlcers, fractures, &amp; diſlocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with ſuch like, which requireth the helpe of the hand. Therefore ther are required foure things in a good Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: firſt, that he be learned &amp; verie ſkilfull in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his art: ſecondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he be wel brought vp vnder ſome cunning man, &amp; wel experienced: thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he be ingenious &amp; wiſe: fourthlie, that he be of good &amp; honeſt manners, and of a vertuous life. The erudition and learning of a Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth conſiſt in knowledge of naturall things, thinges not naturall, and things againſt nature. The experience of a Chyrurgion doth conſiſt in thoſe thinges that are found out by reaſon, and confirmed by dailie vſe and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, for otherwiſe he will bée accounted a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e emperike, which ioyned not reaſon with experience. To be ingenious and wiſe, it is verie neceſſarie, for he ought to haue a readie wit to conceiue things, and a firme memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in calling of them to remembrance, a diſcréete and right iudgement, an excellent perfection in working, a diligent and readie wit in inuenting and finding out of remedies to helpe his grieued Patient withall. The manners and conditions required in a Chirurgion, is boldneſſe, and a minde voide of feare, in neceſſarie things, and in the time of neceſſitie, and not to be too raſh in matters of doubt and perill, gentle and milde towards his Patients, and to thoſe of his profeſſion, to be curteous and gentle, yea, and as the Gréekes call him <hi>Philitairos,</hi> that is a louer of his fellowes, he ought alſo to be prudent and circumſpect in prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vertuous and temperate of life, mercifull toward the poore, and not gréedie of monie, hauing theſe properties, hée may procéede orderlie in learning the art of Chyrurgerie: and the order to be obſerued in the ſame, is to begin with eaſie things, (or as we may tearme them) common things, to perticular, or from vniuerſal things, to thoſe that be leſſe vniuerſall, alſo from things moſt manifeſt and knowen, to things more obſcure, darke, and vnknowen.</p>
               <p>Hetherto we haue ſpoken of that part which doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18258:26"/> to the knowledge of Chyrurgerie, and now we will intreate of the execution and operations of the ſame. The operations which a Chirurgion executeth about the bodie of man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may bring to paſſe his intended ſcope and deſired end, are thrée, that is, to diuide and ſeparate things contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to ioyne and vnite together that which is diuided, &amp; to take awaie that thing which is ſuperfluous. We diuide and ſeparate that thing which is contained by inciſion and exciſion, and by letting of bloud and ſcarification: we doe alſo ioyne and vnite together that which is diuided, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidating of wounds, and reſtoring of members diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, into their proper places, and curing of fractures. Wée take awaie that which is ſuperfluous, by remoouing of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours againſt nature, as <hi>Ganglia, Nodus, Cancers, Strumas, Mirmecias,</hi> and by drawing of water out of the bellies of ſuch as haue the Dropſie, or by cutting off ſuch members as be ſuperfluous, and to doe thoſe things quicklie and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, with a good zeale toward his patient, and not to make anie vaine promiſes for monie, or to take in hande thoſe grifes which cannot be cured, and that he may more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, readilie, and ſafelie, doe thoſe things, it is requiſite that he doe conſider thrée ſpeciall indications, according to the ſaying of <hi>Galen,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſaie: Firſt, the conſeruation of thoſe things which be naturall, and the expulſion of thoſe which be againſt nature: The ſecond indication ſheweth whether we may bring to paſſe and fulfill that which the indication doth require, that is, whether we can conſerue that which is natural, and take awaie that which is againſt nature: The third indication is that which findeth out remedie, &amp; dooth declare vnto vs with what things we may accompliſh that which the firſt indication requireth, and the ſecond giueth leaue to be done: touching the indication which conſiſteth in the conſeruation of naturall things, they be ſixe, that is to ſaie, health, or a naturall aptneſſe, in doing the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of health, the effects of health, which is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to nature: ſtrength, which doth alwayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend againſt ſicknes: cuſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e which is like another nature:
<pb facs="tcp:18258:27"/> Complections and temperaments which are to be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and kept, be their like.

               <p>Note, that which is ſimple is cured by his contrarie, &amp; that which is compound, by their contraries.</p>

               <p>In like manner in compound ſickneſſes, we muſt both conſider the contrarietie of euerie ſimple ſickneſſe, and alſo in applying apt and conuenient medicaments for the ſame: But the indication for applying remedies is taken of that ſickneſſe, which muſt firſt be cured, and that whoſe cure is the curation of another, and that without whoſe cure, the other cannot be cured, yea, and that which moſt grieueth the Patient, and is moſt dangerous, is firſt to be cured. The ſecond indication is that which ſheweth whether we may bring to paſſe that which the firſt indication doth require, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:18258:27"/> is to conſerue things naturall, and to expell thoſe that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, therefore this indication is taken of thinges naturall, as whether health may be reſtored or not, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtrength of the patient ſufficeth for life or not, and whether the cauſe of health may be conſerued, and ſo of the reſt. The indication taken of things againſt nature, is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may cure the ſickneſſe, with his accidence or not, &amp; whether we may reſiſt the cauſe of theſe two, or not, &amp; this is to be knowen thrée waies. Firſt, when the ſickneſſe of his owne proper nature is incurable, as <hi>Elephantiaſis abſolute,</hi> and as they tearme it, confirmed, or when the ſicke patient refuſeth his neceſſarie remedies, when the diſeaſes are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. As for example, the cutting awaie of a member, in which there is a Cancer, &amp;c. Or when the curation brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a worſe and more perillous diſeaſe, as olde Cancer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cured, or continuall Emorodes, for if you cure theſe, there is daunger of life, or of madneſſe, or of conſumption. Nowe, the third indication doth teach conuenient remedies for their curation, their vſe, and inſtruments, wherewith it is brought to paſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe inſtruments is an apt diet or regiment in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vi. things not natural. The ſecond is, <hi>Pharmacon</hi> (which he vnderſtandeth for purging medicaments.) Alſo letting of bloud, with plaiſters, vnguents, pouders, &amp;c.

                  </gap> of his worke, which is the curation of mannes bodie in theſe thinges that hée hath
<pb facs="tcp:18258:28"/> charge of. This is the effect of the words of <hi>Franciſcus Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leriolus,</hi> as well as of <hi>Iohannes Tagaultius,</hi> as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in their words héere aboue written Now my friend, where you did alleadge <hi>Tagaultius</hi> to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought not to miniſter diet and Purgations, neither yet anie inward medicines, for that you ſaie, it doth propertie appertaine to Phiſicke, it ſéemeth to me by the wordes of <hi>Tagaultius,</hi> that it maketh little for your purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi> No ſir, by your ſaying both <hi>Valleriolus</hi> and <hi>Tagaultius</hi> ſaith the contrarie, doe not they ſaie, that a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion ought not to giue inward medicines, without the counſaile of a Phiſition? and declareth what inconuenience hath come by the vndiſcréete miniſtring of the ſame? I take this to be a ſufficient proofe.</p>
               <p>The anſwere. No not ſo ſir, we may not confound the inſtruments, which are neceſſarie to an Arte, becauſe that ſome Artiſts doe abuſe their inſtruments, neither <hi>Tagaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> nor <hi>Valleriolus</hi> meane ſo, but their meaning was, that thoſe that did practiſe the Arte of Chyrurgerie, which dyd not vnderſtand or knowe the principles of their arte, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſes of diſeaſes, nor yet the diſeaſes themſelues, nor how to take indication for the curation, neither yet knoweth the nature of the medicines which he doth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>Theſe be they that <hi>Tagaultius</hi> and other learned men do reproue, which I muſt néeds confeſſe, ought not onelie to be forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in inward medicines, but alſo outward medicines, for if I ſhould ſpeake of all miſchiefes that hath bene done by the applications of outward medicines, how ſome hath bene maimed and vndone for euer, and other ſome brought to death, the number of them would ſéeme verie ſtrange vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and therefore we will let it paſſe at this time, with praier vnto almightie God for his mercifull helpe héerein, that he may moue the hart of the Prince, with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of this Realme, to take ſuch order for the ſafegard of the people, and for the honour of this Realme, &amp; for that that learned men may be the better incouraged to ſtudie this arte. But as concerning the inſtruments, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18258:28"/> theſe two men, neither yet anie other before their time, ſince the time of <hi>Galen,</hi> that hath forbidden the vſe of them to the Chirurgion, for both theſe men doth put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their bookes, as moſt common and ſpecial inſtruments, affirming them as moſt ſpeciall inſtruments pertaining to the art of Chirurgerie, that without theſe, thoſe euill and vicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that hindereth the curation of vlcers, tumours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, &amp;c. cannot be purged awaie, neither can the temperaments &amp; other naturall things of the bodie be kept in perfect ſtate, without an apt and méete diet. But for to counſaile with the Phiſition, being a graue and learned man, in the principles of this arte: In matters of waight, I take it to be verie neceſſarie, for what is he that is wiſe, that will refuſe the counſaile of a wiſe and a learned man, and ſpeciallie of him that profeſſeth the principles of the ſame arte, for <hi>Phiſiologia,</hi> whereof the Phiſition taketh his name, is the firſt and chiefeſt parte, which he that worketh in the art of medicine doth proue, for that it doth conſiſt in the knowledge of the ſeauen natural things, and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue therevnto appertaining. But yet this doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that a learned an expert Chyrurgion ſhould not vſe diet and Purgations, and other inward medicines at all times when néede doth require: for if you would ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, one part of their ſayings ſhould repugne againſt another, and ſo confound the whole, but their mening was, that the vnlearned Chirurgions, and theſe that be younge men, which be not well practiſed, that they ſhoulde take counſayle as well of the learned Phyſition, as of the learned Chyrurgion, for this Arte is ſo ioyneed togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that neyther maye the partes bée diuided, neyther yet the Inſtrumentes, without the ouerthrowe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſhe whole Arte, for it was neuer perfect before the time of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> till that hée ioyned all theſe partes and Inſtrumentes together, and taught a perfect method and waie of curing, by a right vſing and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of the ſame.</p>
               <p>I for my part haue read no few authors, not onelie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecians, but alſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arabians, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latiniſts, yet could I

And the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments be foure likewiſe, as hot, colde, moyſt, and drye. Theſe foure are the matter, whereby all the members of the bodie are made with, the temperamentes, and ſpirites, therein conteined, and he that ſhall cure the bodie of man rightly, muſt chiefely vnderſtand, how to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue euery one of theſe, by their like, and to expel and remoue from them, their contraries. For the knowledge of theſe, it doth behoue the artiſt to haue long experience, and chiefely in that part, which wee call the Anathomie of mans bodie, which is the deuiding and ſeperating of dead bodies, that wée may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vnderſtand all the partes of the ſame bodie, with theyr poſition, figure, number, place, nature, temperature, office, and affects, and alſo to know their names, and true diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which be ſimiler, and which be compound, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall, for of the ſimuler and ſimple members, the compound are made.</p>
               <p>Simuler parts, be theſe, bones, cartilages, ligamentes, <hi>membranas,</hi> or panicles, fleſhe, nerues, arteries, veines, fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the ſkinne.

               <p>The compound or inſtrumentall members, be the head, the heart, the liuer, the legges, the eyes, and all other like. Which member both ſimuler, and compounde, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ought to know, with their natures, temperatures, and actions, and their other neceſſarie properties, or elſe he cannot rightly cure them, when they are greued, and hurt. But in the curing of them that he hurt, he ſhall diſtemper them that be quiet, for how can he conſerue the right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of any thing, whoſe temperature he knoweth

                  <hi>Pathologia</hi> is that part of the arte, which hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſickneſſe againſt nature, with their <hi>Symptoma</hi> and accident, and they be thrée in number, that is to ſaie, ſickneſſe it ſelfe, the cauſe of ſickneſſe, and the accidents, which followeth after ſickneſſe: ſickneſſe it ſelfe may come two waies, either of outward cauſes, or of inward cauſes, we do commonlie call the outward cauſes primatiue, the Gréekes call them <hi>Cathertica,</hi> the inward cauſes, we do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie name Antecedent, or <hi>Internam.</hi> The affectes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie followe theſe cauſes, and if the affectes come of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes, then commonlie they be wounds, contuſions, fractures, diſlocations, biting of mad dogs, &amp; of ſerpents, &amp;c. If they come of inward cauſes, then they make tumors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, as <hi>Phlegmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ereſipula, Oedema, Sirrhus,</hi> with many kinde of malignant and ſtubburne vlcers, to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which tumours and vlcers cannot be made whole, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their cauſes with their euill affects, may be remoued and taken awaie: I ſuppoſe that there is no man, but hée will iudge this part of the art chieflie to pertaine to Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie, for that it taketh cure of wounds, vlcers, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors againſt nature, as I haue ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Then if this part doe appertaine to the art of Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, as it is moſt certaine it doeth, it behoueth the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion perfectlie and rightlie to vnderſtand what kinde of ſickneſſes there be, with their differences &amp; names, what partes of the bodie theſe ſickneſſes may be in, and what manner of ſickneſſe it maketh in the ſame partes. As for example, euill complection maketh a diſtemperature in the ſimiler parts, &amp; euil conſtitution, or euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition, maketh a deformitie or imbecilitie in the inſtrumentall partes. And ſolution of vnitie or continuitie, chaunceth both in the ſimiler partes, and inſtrumentall. And all theſe doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Chirurgion, to haue moſt exact knowledge of, for he that taketh vpon him to cure an vlcer or a wound, or anie other manner of griefe, and doth not know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the parts, neither yet what part it is in, neither yet the cauſe, neither how to remooue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame cauſe, it is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as I haue ſayde before, that he ſhoulde cure the ſame
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18258:32"/> griefes or diſeaſes rightlie. And therefore theſe blinde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perikes that haue neither reaſon nor method, to leade them to doe thoſe things which they dailie doe, I ſaie, their doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſo pernitious, that many people taketh great hurt thereby (ſhall I ſaie hurte) nay rather brought to vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and many times to death. The <hi>Symptoma</hi> or accidents which followeth ſickneſſe, is alſo diuided into thrée partes. The firſt is, the qualitie being altered, as with vehement heate in <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> The action or function hurt, but not vtterlie depriued. The action vtterlie depriued and taken awaie. For theſe cauſes aboue rehearſed, it is ſpeciallie required, that a Chirurgion ſhoulde be learned, and alſo to haue greate experience, that hée maye rightlie iudge and diſcerne one diſeaſe from another, with their natures and cauſes, to the end, that when you come to the curation thereof, you may take right indications, what to do firſt, what next, and ſo foorth to the end, for other waies you may applie medicines nothing fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but thoſe that might doe great harme, and you might alſo applie thoſe firſt that would be applied laſt, and thoſe laſt which ſhould be applyed firſt, and in the end marre all your workes, as the blinde Carpenter doth. Thus farre I haue proued for <hi>Phiſiologia,</hi> to be one part of Chyrurgerie, or of the Art of curing, as we may tearme it, and I thinke there is no man that will count him to be a right Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that lacketh this part of the Arte, or that is not verie expert in the ſame. And for the further knowledge héereof, there be certaine bookes appointed of <hi>Galen,</hi> and other aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, that you may reade concerning the ſame part as hereafter followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Libro Hippocrates, de Morbis, libro Epedimſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Hippocrates, Galen de locis affectis, Galen de Morbis &amp; Symptomatis, &amp; de 4. temporibus morborum, Galen de differentijs morborum cauſis &amp; Smptomatis, Galen de inequali intemperie, Galen de arte Medica, Galen de tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moribus, praeter naturam. Hippocrates de Vulneribus vlce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, &amp; Fiſtulis, fracturis, immorodibus, &amp;c.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Galen</hi> in his whole Worke called <hi>Therapeuticon,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18258:33"/> and in another worke to his Diſciple <hi>Glaucon,</hi> as it is manifeſt to be ſéene. Theſe two moſt excellent men béeing the patrones and fathers of the arte, haue written moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentlie and perfectlie of many diſeaſes, as woundes, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours againſt naturne, vlcers, and many other diſeaſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the ſame art, as it maye more manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in theſe bookes aboue rehearſed, and in manie other more of their workes. If I ſhoulde write of all men that accounteth this a proper and a principall parte of Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, then I muſt néeds confeſſe the truth, all men learned in this art ſince the time of <hi>Galen,</hi> haue ſo written, and ſo taken it. Thus I conclude for this parte, that hée that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth it not, ye muſt giue him a baſer name, ye may not call him a Chirurgion, that neither knoweth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his arte, neither yet the nature of his ſubiect that he worketh vpon.</p>
               <p>I remember when I was in the warres at <hi>Mutterell,</hi> in the time of that moſt famous Prince, King <hi>Henrie</hi> the viii. there was a great rablement there, that tooke vpon them to be Chirurgions, ſome were ſowe gelders, &amp; ſome horſe gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with Tinkers and Coblers. This noble ſect did ſuch great cures, that they got to themſelues a perpetual name, for like as <hi>Theſalus</hi> ſect were call <hi>Theſſalions,</hi> ſo was this noble rable for their notorious cures, called Dogge léeches, for in two dreſſings they did commonlie make their cures whole and ſound for euer, ſo that they neither felt heate nor cold, nor yet no maner of paine after: but when the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> who was then general, vnderſtood how the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did die, and that of ſmal wounds, he ſent for me and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other Chirurgions, commaunding vs to make ſearch how theſe men came to their death, whether it were by the grieuouſneſſe of their woundes, or by the lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Chyrurgions, and we according to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, made ſearch throughout all the camp, &amp; found many of the ſame good fellowes, which tooke vppon them the names of Chirurgions, not onelie the names, but the wages alſo: we aſking of them whether they were Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions or no, they ſayde they were, we demaunded with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18258:33"/> whom they were brought vp, and they with ſhameleſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would aunſwere, either with one cunning man or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother which was dead: Then we demaunded of them what Chyrurgerie ſtuffe they had to cure men withall, and they wold ſhew vs a pot or a boxe which they had in a bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, wherein was ſuch trumperie as they did vſe to greaſe horſe héeles withall, and layed vpon ſcabbed horſe backes, with neruall, and ſuch like. And other that were Coblers and Tinkers, they vſed ſhoomakers waxe, with the ruſt of olde pans, &amp; made therewithall a noble ſalue, as they did terme it. But in the end this worthy rablement was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Marſialſie, and threatned by the Dukes grace to be hanged, for their worthie déeds, except they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth what they were, and of what occupations, and in the end they did confeſſe, as I haue declared to you before: wherevppon the Dukes grace gaue commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they ſhould auoide the Campe in paine of death, and if at anie time they came within the Campe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they ſhould immediatlie be hanged, as murtherers, his Grace calling them by the name of Dogge léeches, commaunding his Captaines that they ſhould entertaine no more ſuch.</p>
               <p>Thus you vnderſtand by what name thoſe men were then called, which tooke vpon them vnworthilie to vſe this Arte, knowing neither the principles of this arte, neither yet the nature of the diſeaſes, nor yet the medicamentes wherewithall they could cure the ſame diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Thus we conclude with theſe examples before, that it is neceſſarie for a Chirurgion to know theſe partes, or elſe not to be admitted to ſo worthie an Arte, which doeth take charge, not onelie of mans health, but alſo of their liues and lims. And thus we end this part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eugiena</hi> is the third parte, pertaining to the art of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie, or Medicine, as we haue ſayde before. This part doth conſiſt in the ſixe things not naturall, called <hi>Res non naturalis,</hi> which followeth.</p>

               <p>This is alſo a ſpeciall and a neceſſarie part to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of the Chirurgion, for without this knowledge he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue conuenient diet, neither yet conuenient order for the gouernment of the diſeaſed and ſicke Patient, nor yet at what time he ſhoulde ſléepe, at what time he ſhould eate and drinke, or what manner of meates and drinkes hée ſhould haue, and whether they ſhoulde bée liquide in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce or groſe and thicke, neither ſhall he knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame meate and drinke maye augment the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe or not, by meanes whereof, he may giue ſuch diet to his patients, as may confirme their diſeaſes. As for example, in <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> and <hi>Cancers,</hi> which by eating of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like meates, or ſuch meate and drinke as doth make aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bloud which doth confirme them. There might be many more thinges ſaide of meate and drinke, which is not materiall to be ſpoken héere, for I thinke no man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but that this inſtrument doth chieflie appertaine vnto this Arte, for it is not poſſible for a Chirurgion to cure his grieued patient, except he giue conuenient diet, &amp; with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient diet many greate grieuous wounds, and manie other cruell ſickneſſes, by the helpe of other conuenient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines haue bene cured.</p>
               <p>And as for the gouernment by the aire, euerie man that hath anie knowledge will confeſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> colde ſickneſſes which are taken by cold, are to be cured in places where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire is warme, or elſe it ought to be made warme by art, according to the time of the yeare, for it is one of the principles and ſpeciall rules which <hi>Galen</hi> commaundeth vs to kéepe, that we ſhall cure euerie thing by his contrarie, as heate by colde, colde diſeaſes by hot thinges, drineſſe by moiſture, and moiſture with thoſe thinges that bée drie, fulneſſe by abſtinence, and euacuation by emptineſſe, by things of good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18258:34"/> nouriſhment to fill withall, watching, by thinges that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſléepe, &amp; ouer much ſléepe, by kéeping of them waking. Thus euerie thing is ouercommed and holpen by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, by meanes whereof the Chirurgion doth more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and readilie reſtore to health, his grieued &amp; wounded pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieut, without which thinges, and their right vſe, could not be done. And therefore this part is called a moſt neceſſarie and principall thing appertaining to the Artiſt. There is another vtilitie in this part alſo, which the Chirurgion of neceſſitie muſt vſe, for <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that euerie Artiſt that will rightlie cure, muſt intend two thinges. The firſt is to conſerue and kéepe euerie thing that is in good ſtate, by his like.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is to expell, and cure thoſe things that bée contrary to nature, by their contraries, which we cannot do without theſe ſixe things not naturall. Therefore it may be ſaide, <hi>Neceſsitas non legem habet,</hi> therefore there ought no lawe to bée made againſt that thing that muſt be of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie. As for example, of neceſſitie we muſt eate &amp; drinke, that we may liue. Therefore it were tyrannicall to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde vs to eate and drinke, for they be proper things for vs whereby we doe liue. But yet the abuſing of meate and drinke may be ſpoken againſt, and good and iuſt lawes made for the reformation thereof.</p>
               <p>In like manner for abuſing the arte of Phiſicke or Chirurgerie, there hath béene good and wholeſome lawes made héertofore, and I truſt in our Lord God ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after againe. But to commaund from them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their arte, or anie parte thereof, or other neceſſarie inſtruments or medicaments, wherewith they ſhould cure their grieued and wounded Patients, which other wayes muſt of neceſſitie periſh, or elſe not bée cured at all: Such commaundements or lawes were tyrannicall, and not to be well thought of, for that they ſhould let the workes of mercie, in this moſt excellent arte of curing, to be miniſtred vnto the people orderlie for their ſafegard, &amp; curing of their diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>There were much to be ſpoken of theſe ſixe vnnaturall
<pb facs="tcp:18258:35"/> things, which maketh nothing for my purpoſe héere in this place, for that I intend nothing but to proue that theſe bée neceſſarie inſtruments, for the Arte of Chyrurgerie, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine examples, as you haue heard: for theſe things are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of at large, not onelie in many worthie bookes, which are ſet forth by <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> but alſo in all other worthie mens bookes, that haue written of this art at large, as it may appeare at this preſent daie. Some men might héere aſke a queſtion, why theſe are called not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, for it is to be thought, that ſléepe, meate, and drinke, moouing, &amp;c. ſhould be naturall. But foraſmuch as both health and ſickneſſe doth come by theſe things, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be called not naturall. They bée not called againſt nature: for ſickneſſe, the cauſe of ſickneſſe, and the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that follow ſickneſſe, thoſe be called <hi>Praeter naturam,</hi> &amp; againſt nature. Neither may they bée called naturall, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that ſickneſſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But they are indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not natural. Theſe things are ſo neceſſary for our bodies, as I haue ſaid before, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do not onlie liue by them, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter &amp; ſubſtanticall of our bodies, after generation, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and mainteined by them, and alſo all the humours and temperaments with the ſpirits, and other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſame bodie, ſhould vtterlie ceaſe if it were not but for thoſe ſixe thinges. Thus I conclude with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples aforeſaid, to proue this part to be neceſſarie for the art of Chirurgerie, doubting nothing, but thoſe that be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men and men of reaſon will ſo iudge, for ſo haue the auncient fathers before our daies, appointed it to be. Now that you may the better come to the perfect knowledge of theſe things, I thinke it good to declare vnto you ſome of the bookes which both <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>Hyppocrates de elementis, Hyppo. de Aqua Aere, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionibus, Hyppo. de flatibus, Hyppo. de vrinarum differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tijs, Hyppo. de ratione victus ſalubris, Hyppo. de ratione vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus prauatoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Galen de ſanitate tuenda, Galen de imperica, dieta ſub figuratione, Galen de aqua, Gal. de ptiſſana. Galen de Euchimia, &amp; Caccochimia, Galen de attenuante &amp; craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante victu,</hi> with many more bookes, written by moſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18258:35"/> excellent men, ſence their times, which were ſuperfluous, here to be reherſed, for as much as theſe are moſt neceſſary to be vnderſtoode, and ſufficient for the profe hereof: And thus I commit this part vnto your friendly iudgement, procéeding vnto the fourth part, called <hi>Semiotica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Semiotica,</hi> is an other part, perteining to the arte of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie, which part doth iudge by ſignes, and toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, what the diſeaſes are, and what be their natures, and what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors or other things be the cauſe therof, and whether they may be cured eaſely, and in ſhort time, or whether they be hard to be cured, &amp; muſt be cured in longer time, or if they cannot be cured at all. Or elſe whether it is not neceſſarie, that it be not cured at all, leaſt worſe diſeaſes, ſhould come by the curation of them, and ſpecially, this part is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, about the curatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wounds, to know which are dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and which are not deadly, and alſo which are maymed, and which are not maymed, and to foreſée, daungerous and perillous accidents, which might chaunce vnto the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded man, as <hi>paraliſis, conuulſions, gangrena, ſpaſalus,</hi> and manie other more daungerous diſeaſes, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chirurgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not onely to foreſée, by meanes whereof he might reſiſt the ſame. But alſo, when any of the greuous accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, doe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, he might make a good and a true prognoſticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what might happen after theſe greuous, and perilous ſickneſſes, and alſo in wounds, that chaunceth in daungerous places, to prognoſticate, and declare the great perill thereof, vnto the ſicke and gréeued pacient, or elſe vnto his friendes, as it ſhall be thought moſt conuenient: for except he make a true and a iuſt prognoſtication, he ſhall get vnto him ſelfe diſhoneſtie, and cauſe the worthie arte, to be euil ſpoken of. This parte of the Arte can not be attained vnto, without great knowledge, and long experience, and alſo a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wit. For <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> ſayth, in his <hi>Aphoriſmus,</hi> that this part, is the moſt hardeſt, he ſaith, that the lyfe of man is ſhort, the arte of medicine long, the occaſions to miniſter medicines many, prouing of experiments, perillous, but iudgement, and prognoſtication of ſickneſſe, to be moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and hard.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:36"/>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> did will all men, that would auoyde ſlander, and euill name, to beware, &amp; wiſe, in prognoſticating, and not to be raſhe and quicke. How many men haue gotten diſhoneſtie, for lacke of knowledge of this parte of the Arte, and by miſtaking of the <hi>Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> and accidents, it were wonderfull, to number them. And alſo how many ſick men haue béene ouerthrowen, and vndone, for lake of knowledge of the ſame parte, it is not to be ſpoken. Wherefore this part is moſt neceſſarie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth moſt diligent and exacte ſtudie, as it doth appeare, both by <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hippo,</hi> in <hi>Galen,</hi> where he hath written vi. bookes, <hi>de differentiis &amp; cauſis morborum, &amp; Symptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> which doth chiefely perteine to this parte of the Arte. And alſo that moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and worthie man <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> hath written two diuine workes, wherein is conteined di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers bookes, the one called his <hi>Aphoriſmus,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other his prognoſtications, which are the moſt worthieſt bookes that euer were written, for him that ſhall practiſe in this Arte, for therein may he learne the diuine iudgement of <hi>Hippo.</hi> And alſo how to prognoſticate rightly, which two thinges, doe moſt chiefely and principally appertaine to the Art of Chirurgery. Thus I haue declared vnto you, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts, or as we may tearme them, the foure principal pillers, or foundaments of this art, without the knowledge of which foure, no man may rightly, or methodically work, in the ſame arte. I dare not ſay, no man ought to worke in this Arte, that vnderſtandeth not theſe, leaſt I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne a great ſort, but I will ſay, as <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Guido, Valleriolus, Tagaltius,</hi> and many other worthy men doe ſay, that theſe are the principles of the Arte, and they ought firſt to be learned, and trained vp, in the knowledge of theſe, before they be permitted to woorke in the Arte, for in the olde time, they did firſt learne their principles, and had them by heart, and then they were brought vp, vnder ſome cunning maiſter, where they might ſée the ſame put in practiſe, and ſo trained vp in moſt exact and perfect expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: And thus being brought vp, they were able to iudge in their art, &amp; ſo they did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitute &amp; builded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe foure
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18258:36"/> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, a moſt excellent art, which <hi>Galen</hi> calleth <hi>Therapeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticon,</hi> that is to ſaie, the art of curing, which part, thoſe that are diſpoſed to reade their works may plainlie vnderſtand, and ſpecially in a booke called <hi>Introductio, ſeu medicus.</hi> Thus I haue proued theſe foure parts, as I haue ſaid before, to be the Theorike part of Chirurgerie, and we intend to proue <hi>Therapeuticon</hi> to be the practike part, for that it doth cure diſeaſes &amp; griefes of mans bodie. <hi>Guido, Tagaltius,</hi> &amp; other, did not make theſe fiue diuiſions of parts, as I haue done, but diuided the art into two parts, that is, into the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, and Practike: for <hi>Guido</hi> ſaith, that he which woulde vſe the arte of Chirurgerie, muſt be learned in the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike part, as wel as in the Practike part, but <hi>Guido</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the Theorike part to be Phiſicke, and the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike part to be Chirurgerie, as it may appeare by his words héereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conditiones quae requiruntur in Chirurgo, ſunt quatuor, prima eſt quod ſit literatus, ſecunda, quod ſit exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, tertia, quod ſit ingenioſus, quarta, quod ſit morigeratus: Riquiritur quod ſit Chirurgus literatus, non tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pijs Chirurgiae, &amp; ſed etiam Phiſicae tam in Theorica, quam in Practica. In Theorica, oportet quod ipſe cognoſcat res na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turales, &amp; non naturales, &amp; contra naturam, precipue Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomiam, nam, ſine ipſa factum eſt nihil, in Chirurgia.</hi> The Engliſh is this. There be foure conditions ſpeciallie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Chyrurgion: firſt, that he be learned: ſecond, that he be expert: third, that he be ingenious, and fourth, that he be well mannered: It is further requiſite, that the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion be not onelie learned in the principles of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, but alſo in Phiſick, as well in Theorike as in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike: In Theorike, it behooueth him to knowe thinges naturall not naturall, and things againſt nature.</p>
               <p>Thus it maye manifeſtlie appeare by the wordes of <hi>Guido,</hi> that he vnderſtoode the Theorike part to be Philick, and the Practike part to be Chirurgerie, for other diuiſions made he none, but vſed the art indifferently together, that is to ſaie, diet, purging medicaments, and all other things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the art of Chirurgerie. Theſe foure partes
<pb facs="tcp:18258:37"/> that we haue ſpoken off before, were accounted to be Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, as <hi>Guido</hi> and all other later writers doe make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and euerie one of them ſuppoſeth, that a Chyrurgion ought to know theſe partes, either elſe he cannot rightlie and methodicallie worke in his arte: But when he dooth vnderſtand theſe parts, and is well brought vp in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the ſame, and hath alſo good vnderſtanding &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both in the ſimples and compounds, whereof he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his medicaments, and hath ſéene long experience, and vſe of the ſame, I thinke him then a man méete and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be allowed to vſe the practike parte of Chirurgerie, or elſe not, for otherwiſe he ſhould be ignorant in the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many grieuous diſeaſes, which doth appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this art, that cannot be cured other waies, but by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the hand, for this parte called <hi>Chirurgia</hi> is the laſt remedie in the arte of medicine, and cureth thoſe things which are moſt hard and difficult to be cured, and therefore it is accounted amongſt the auncient writers, as both <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> doe affirme, to be moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and moſt worthie, as we ſhall declare more héereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Treatiſe of the methode of curing, called <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeuticon.</hi> And thus wée end this fourth parte, called <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miotica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it doth behoue vs to ſpeake of the laſt part called <hi>Therapeutica,</hi> and although it be laſt in number, yet it is chiefe in effect, and moſt profitable in the common wealth. For <hi>Therapeu</hi> is no other thing to be vnderſtoode, than <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio,</hi> and <hi>Curatio</hi> is nothing elſe, but to helpe mans bodie of wounds, ſickneſſe, and other infirmities, as I haue ſayd before.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Guido</hi> doth ſaie, that this arte doth reſtore mans bodie vnto health by the curation of wounds, vlcers, tumours againſt nature, fractures, diſlocations, and all other infirmities wherewith the ſame bodie is grieued.</p>
               <p>And he addeth and ſaith further, as much as lyeth in the Chirurgion to doe. For he ſaith, that it lieth not alwayes in the Artiſt to reſtore his ſicke patient to health, for that that manie diſeaſes be incurable, which the Artiſts ought
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18258:37"/> to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and know, and to make true, and right prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication thereof, leaſt he ſhould get vnto himſelfe great ſhame, and bring infamy and ſlaunder to the noble arte.</p>
               <p>Therefore, one <hi>Vego,</hi> a Spaniard, who hath made a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie commentarie vpon the prognoſtikes, of <hi>Hippo.</hi> ſayth, that it doth behoue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> artiſt chiefely, to prognoſticate right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely, of thoſe things, which are to come, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowen, neither could the daunger thereof be auoided if it were poſſible, neither yet ſhould y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> artiſt auoyd a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous &amp; pernicious name. And therefore he deuideth this arte into thrée parts, that is, into <hi>agnoſtica, prognoſtica,</hi> and <hi>curatiua, Agnoſtica,</hi> he vnderſtandeth to be, the knowledge of naturall things, of things not naturall, and of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature. <hi>Prognoſtica,</hi> he vnderſtandeth to be, a right iudgement, in the foreſaide thinges, which he doth gather by the <hi>Symptomata,</hi> of the bodie, &amp; other excrements which nature doth auoyde. <hi>Curatiua,</hi> is that part which followeth both theſe and with knowledge and right iudgement, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly, prognoſticating the ſame, he doth take vpon him, perfectly to cure mans bodie, of thoſe griefes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, wherewith it is hurt, either elſe, if the ſame may not be cured, to preſerue the ſame, from further vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience, as much as is poſſible for this arte to doe.</p>
               <p>Thus it ſéemeth to mée, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woords of this great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, as well as by the woords of <hi>Guido. &amp;c.</hi> That this part of the arte, called <hi>Therapeutica,</hi> or <hi>curatio,</hi> conſiſteth in two ſpeciall points, (that is to ſay) in the curing of mans bodie perfectly, and in the preſeruation of the ſame bodie, when the diſeaſes are incurable, as in Cancers. &amp;c. as wée haue ſaide before.</p>
               <p>There be other learned men that deuide this Arte, but into two partes, that is to ſay, into <hi>Theorica,</hi> and <hi>Practica, Theorike,</hi> doth conſiſt in the exact and perfect knowledge of theſe foure partes, which we haue ſpoken of before, that is to ſaye, in <hi>Phiſiologia, Pathologia, Eugiena,</hi> and <hi>Simiotica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the fiue parts named <hi>Therapeutica,</hi> doth conſiſt in the right practiſing &amp; vſing of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient remedies, to cure mans bodie with all, by the helpe, vnderſtanding, and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:18258:38"/> of thoſe things aboue ſpecified, &amp; for as much as this part, doth bring to paſſe by an operation, and practiſe done with the hand, or miniſtred by the hand, therefore this part is called <hi>Practica,</hi> that is to ſay, practiſing and putting in vſe all ſuch neceſſarie things, as may apperteine, either for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or preſeruation of mans bodie. And for as much, as theſe two thinges are brought to paſſe and done, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine wayes and meanes, which reaſon hath inuented, and experience hath found true, and without theſe things, wée can not rightly cure, or bring to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſired ſcope or ende of our Arte, which we doe intend. Therefore, it followeth of neceſſitie, that wée muſt néedes vſe them, either elſe wée ſhall not vſe the practike part, which is the onely ende, and function of our vocation and Arte. And theſe things be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly termed inſtruments, which inſtruments are apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Almightie God, to helpe vp in the time of néede, for without theſe, wée can doe nothing in this Arte. The firſt is dyet, the ſecond is medicaments, the third is our handes, to miniſter the ſame with all, and theſe are named general inſtruments, and alſo ſpeciall, for that, that all the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers, and moſt excellent men of this Arte, did alwayes ſo vſe them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, I thinke there is no reaſonable man, or any that is learned in this Arte, that will ſay the contrarie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he will wilfully, and willingly, condemne both reaſon and experience, and not onely experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and reaſon, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo theſe two moſt worthie and famous men, <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi> This part or thoſe that vſe it, hath alſo founde out many notable medicaments, with their natures, and hidden properties, which otherwayes, by the Theorike part could neuer be found out, yet by long practiſe and expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the natures, qualities, and hidden properties, are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out, to no ſmall helpe of the Arte of medicine, for by their natures and qualities, they are methodically vſed, and doe cure griefes, and diſeaſes, as ſickneſſes, which be hot, are cured by cold thinges, thoſe that be moyſt by drye thinges, &amp;c. But thoſe which doe cure by hidden properties, are ſuch, as no reaſon can be made vnto, as for example. To expell
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18258:38"/> venim, either in the peſtilence, or in <hi>Morbo camilliontiaci,</hi> in lepra, or in biting of any venimous beaſt, theſe are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cured, with medicaments, which doth it of propertie, rather then qualitie. Thus it doth behoue the artiſt, which will deale in this parte, called <hi>Therapeutica</hi> or <hi>practica,</hi> not onely to haue perfect knowledge, in all theſe thinges afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide, but alſo to haue a very exact knowledge of all ſuch ſimples, as he will make his medicaments of, or as he doth intend to miniſter vnto mans bodie, any maner of way, not onely as is ſaide before, their natures, and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo their qualities, and hidden properties: and alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times, when they ſhould be gathered, how they ſhould be kept, and preſerued, how long they will continue in ther vertue, and ſtrength, and whether they be of more force and vertue when they be greene, or when they be drye. All theſe thinges doth apperteine vnto the Artiſt to know, and alſo, to what vſe he ought to miniſter the ſame, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie may come thereby. Theſe things, as I haue ſayde vnto you before, are knowen two maner of wayes, that is to ſay, by reaſon, and experience, neither can they be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by any third way, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in his third booke, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Therapeuticon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is requiſit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this Artiſt be not onely lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in the Theorike part, as we haue ſaide before, but alſo, to be learned and brought vp, vnder ſome cunning man, which hath good knowledge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame arte, or otherwaies, it is not poſſible, to come to the exact and perfect knowledge thereof, which is chiefely &amp; principally required. If I ſhould tell you, of the vngratious witchcraftes, and of the fooliſh and miſchiuous abuſes, &amp; miſuſes, that haue bene in times paſt, and yet in our dayes continually vſed, ye would not a little maruaile thereat. But for as much, as it hath not only turned to the diſhonor of God, but alſo, the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth: I haue thought it good to declare vnto you, part of their wicked doings, that it may be vnto you which profeſſeth this Arte, an example, to auoyde the like moſt wretched deeds. Theſe things, I do not ſpeak to you of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, but of mine owne knowledge. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere. 1562. I did ſée
<pb facs="tcp:18258:39"/> in the two Hoſpitalls of London, called S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and ſaint <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> Hoſpitall, to the number of CCC. and odde poore people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were diſeaſed of ſore legges, ſore armes, féete, and handes, with other parts of the bodie, ſo ſore infected, that a hundreth and twentie of them could neuer be recouered, without loſſe of a legge, or an arme, a foote or a hand, fingers, or toes, or elſe their limmes crooked, ſo that, they were either maymed, or elſe vndone for euer. All theſe were brought to this miſchiefe, by witches, by women, by counterfait iauills, that tooke vpon them to vſe the Art, not onely robbing them of their money, but of their limmes, and perpetuall health. And I with certaine other, diligently examining theſe poore people, how they came by theſe gréeuous hurtes, and who were their Chirurgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that looked vnto them, and they confeſſed, that they were either witches, which did promiſe by charmes, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whole, or elſe ſome women which would make them whole with hearbes, and ſuch like things, or elſe ſome vacabound iauil, which runneth from one countrie to an other, promiſing vnto them health, onely to deceaue them of their money.</p>
               <p>This fault and crime, of the vndoing of this people, were layed vnto the Chirurgions, I will not ſay, by part of thoſe that were at that time maiſters of the ſame Hoſpitalls, but it was ſaide, that Carpinters, women, weuers, coblers, and tinkers, did cure more people, then the Chirurgions. But what maner of cures they did, I haue told you before, ſuch cures, as all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world may wonder at: yea, I ſay ſuch cures, as maketh the diuell in hell to daunce for ioye, to ſée the poore members of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo miſerably tormented.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſaie, here vnto, but lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and pray vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for his precious bloud ſake, that he ſhed vpon the croſſe, to illuminate the hearts of the magiſtrates, for amendement hereof. And that this rablement of runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, with witches, baudes, and the diuells ſothſaiers, with tinkers, coblers, and ſow gelders, and all other their wicked coherents, of theſe ſame diueliſh and wicked ſectes, which doth thus abuſe this noble arte of medicine, to the vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſing of the ſame, may be reformed and ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and euery
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18258:39"/> one to get their liuing with truth, in the ſame arts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue ben brought vp &amp; wel experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in, either els to be gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſlie puniſhed, as they be in all other Countries, and as they haue bene héere in this Countrie in times paſt. For ſéeing there is lawes made for him that ſtealeth a ſhéepe, an oxe, or an horſe, which is but a beaſt and ſerueth to mans vſe, and hée that looſeth the ſame, looſeth no more but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the vſe thereof, why may it not be as well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the loſſe of an arme or a legge? yea, and many times of the life, which theſe wicked generation doe ſpoile, I thinke the Prince is bound in conſcience, as wel to puniſh thoſe falſe and wicked pernitious deceiuers, which doeth not onelie deſtroie the lims of man, but his life, as to puniſh theſe which ſteale ſhéep, oxen, or horſes. Of this ſort I think <hi>London</hi> to be as well ſtored, as the Countrie, I thinke there be not ſo few in <hi>London</hi> as thrée ſcore women, that occupieth the arte of Phiſicke and Chirurgerie. Theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome of them be called wiſe women, or holie and good women, ſome of them be called Witches, and vſeth to call vpon certaine ſpirits, and ſome of them vſeth plaine bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derie, and telleth Gentlewomen that cannot beare children how they may haue children. What manner of other ſorts and ſects there be of theſe, as ſome for ſore breaſtes, ſome for the ſtone and Strangurie, ſome for paine of the téeth, ſome for ſcald heads, ſome for ſore legges, ſome cunning in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tomſons</hi> tubbe, and ſome to helpe maides when they haue loſt their maidenhead, when their bellies are growen too great, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſmall againe, with a thouſand more. <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke of ſects, did neuer make mention of the fourth part ſo manie, I thinke, if this worſhipfull rable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were gathered together, they would make a greater profeſſion than euer did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monks, the Friers, &amp; the Nuns, when they did ſwarme moſt in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This vnprofitable companie haue ſo increaſed within the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> that all the Countries in <hi>England</hi> haue taken inſample thereof, yea, and at this daie all the Countries in Chriſtendome may wonder at our lawes in ſuffering and maintaining of them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:40"/>
               <p>Well I ſay, wée will let all theſe paſſe, with tinkers, cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ſouters, and ſow gelders, and a great many of occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more, whereof, ſome commeth out of Fraunce, ſome out of Germany, and ſo of other countries, ſome for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſome for picking of purſes. &amp;c. All theſe now, are become great Phiſicions, and Chirurgions, to no ſmall aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this noble Arte of Medicine, for their noble and worthie cures, doth beare witneſſe thereof, and giueth ſo good report vnto them, that at this day, the learned Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and Chirurgions, may not a little reioyce. Well, I ſay no more, but God amend all, and except theſe things be quickly amended, I thinke the diſeaſed people, and ſuch as haue vlcers, woundes, diſeaſes, and ſores, are like to haue ſmall helpe, and if it ſhall chaunce, the prince to haue wars, then are this company that I haue ſpoken of, like to ſerue, and I doubt nothing, but that the ſouldiers ſhal haue great courage to fight, for ſo much, as they ſhal haue, ſuch a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly companie of Chirurgions, to cure them, when they be wounded. As for other Chirurgions, there will be but a fewe left, except better order be taken, and that with ſpéed. Well, now wée will procéede to our matter againe.</p>
               <p>Now my welbeloued brethren, ye haue hard of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious company, with their damnable déedes, which may be vnto you, an example, to incourage you, to flye igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, and to learne the exact, and methodicall way of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, according to knowledge, &amp; alſo to know theſe things, that doth appertaine vnto the ſame, not onely theſe v. parts, aboue rehearſed or thrée, or two, as it ſéemeth good to you, to deuide them, for it is not materiall, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, ſo that you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the thing. Not onely theſe, I ſay, ought to be perfectly knowen, but alſo, all medicines, both ſimple, and compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, with their natures and properties, their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and right applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and at what time the ſame ought to be miniſtred, to what partes of the bodie, and for what griefes and diſeaſes: and alſo, according to right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications taken, what ought to be firſt miniſtred, what next, and ſo to the laſt.</p>
               <p>All theſe thinges, as I haue ſaide, doe appertaine vnto
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18258:40"/> the right and true Chirurgion, not onely to know, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo orderly to follow, or elſe he ſhall be accounted an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prike, and little better then one of theſe rude rablement, which I haue ſpoken of before. Wherefore, my well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued bretheren, that vſe this arte of Chirugria, I exhort you in the name of Almightie God, that you your ſelues, be not onely diligent in learning of all theſe partes, and other thinges, neceſſarie, appertaining vnto your arte: by meanes whereof, not onely murther, and other greuous miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which might happen, through your ignorance, may be auoyded, but alſo perpetuall ſlander, with all other infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous report, and diſpleaſure, may be likewiſe auoyded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And that in like maner, your ſeruaunts, and children, which you doe intend to bring vp in this Arte, be learned, not onely to write and reade, but alſo in the tongues, that he may more exactly vnderſtand theſe parts, as I haue ſaid before. And ſo by this meanes, you ſhall not onely reſtore the Arte, againe vnto her good name, which is almoſt loſt, at this preſent daye, through that foule and vgly monſter, ignoraunce, but alſo get vnto your ſelues, perpetual honor, and good fame.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, by your excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t knowledge, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous liues, and cunning déedes, which followeth after, and are the fruites of knowledge, by theſe thinges, I ſaye, and with the helpe of the high and mightie Lord God, you ſhall aboliſh and put downe, theſe wicked and pernitious ſectes, which are no leſſe vnprofitable, vnto Gods people, in the common wealth of their countries, then caterpillers, and Graſſehoppers, are vnto the fruites, and herbes of the ground, which ſectes, be not onely pernitious, as I haue ſaid before, but perillous, and ſelaunderous, vnto you, that be the true profeſſers of the Arte, for they call themſelues, by the name of Phiſitions or Chirurgions: And the ſimple ignoraunt people, doe ſo receue them, or thinke them to be, but in déede, they be ſuch as Chriſt ſpeketh of, wher he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they come in ſhéepes clothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, &amp; be raueni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wolues, ſo theſe come w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good names, &amp; be craftie, and pernitious deceauers, which are to be driuen out of euery good common welth.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:41"/>
               <p>Thus (moſt gentle Reader) I haue troubled you with a long talke, deſiring you to beare with my ſimple and rude ſtile, wiſhing with all my heart, that it had bene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and deſiring you moſt humblie where you finde anie fault, curteouſlie to amend the ſame, or elſe to giue mée knowledge, and I ſhall be as willing to amend them, as I haue bene diligent in ſetting it forth, praying you to leaue off ſlaunderous wordes and euill iudgement: by meanes whereof I haue bene greatlie impaired, not onelie in my good name, but alſo in the profite and commoditie of my arte, which is to my great hinderaunce: and this hath partlie riſen by a booke of Chirurgerie which I haue late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſet forth, to my great coſt and charge, and ſome men haue not let to ſaie, that it was onelie Doctor <hi>Cuninghams</hi> doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and none of mine. Vnto whom I anſwere. That <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham</hi> was the writer thereof, and put the ſame booke in order, as you may now ſée, for I my ſelfe hauing not perfect vnderſtanding of the tongues, required him, for the more perfection thereof, to put in the Gréeke &amp; Latine words, in ſuch ſort as he thought good. And for the matter in the moſt part therein contained, you may verie well perceiue that it was mine owne practiſe, as the ſtories therin contained for the curation of diuerſe people, doth declare, which I my ſelf did cure, as it may more at large appeare in the ſame booke. And for the medicines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be written in the ſame booke, their names which deuiſed the ſame medicines, are put vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is but a ſlaunderous, vntrue, &amp; malitious reporte, onlie to deface me of my good name, without any deſeruing or cauſe reaſonable.</p>
               <p>For it is well knowen, that Maiſter <hi>Cuningham</hi> neuer did anie ſuch cures, as there is mention made of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet is Maiſter <hi>Cuningham</hi> anie Chyrurgion, as yée may perceiue farther in his own Epiſtle written vnto the ſame booke, wherein he doeth not onelie declare my paines and trauaile in collecting certaine partes of Chyrurgerie, but alſo my great expenſes and painfull labours in collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſetting forth of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſlaunderous and euill wordes haue cauſed me to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18258:41"/> ſet pen to booke my ſelfe, to auoide that foule and euill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured monſter, falſe detraction, and alſo to ſpare my expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which I before did l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And I haue taken paines now mine owne ſelfe, without anie other helpe of liuing men, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent daie, but of mine owne trauaile, and collected them out of theſe famous authors, which I haue before rehearſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and although it be not in ſo good forme and eloquent ſtile, as it might haue bene, if a better learned man had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it in hand, yet the truth is not to be reiected, becauſe of the barbarouſneſſe of the ſtile, or words. Thus I leaue off leaſt I ſhould be tedious vnto you.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſpeake of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d of this noble art, or as you will ſaie, to what ende this art doeth ſerue. The end of this art of Medicine is, to reſtore mans bodie to health, as much as lieth in this Artiſt to do, ſo that the end of this art conſiſteth in the curation of diſeaſes, or as we may tearme it reſtoring of health. For man at his birth was caſt into this world naked, and vncouered, requiring the helpe of other things to couer his nakedneſſe withall, neuer leauing crying and wéeping, till ſuch time as reaſon and nature had prouided for him ſuch neceſſarie thinges as dyd growe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the earth, either elſe vpon ſome other creatures, by meanes whereof, hée was both nouriſhed and alſo clothed, and alſo by the vertue of other thinges that the Earth brought forth, reſtored to health in the time of his grieuous infirmities.</p>
               <p>But how was he reſtored to health? Truelie by Arte. And by what Arte, euen by the art of Medicine, which doth comprehend both Phiſick and Chirurgerie, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all ſimple Medicines, and compound medicaments, and all other things whatſoeuer doe appertaine vnto the ſame. And therfore I will ſaie, as that worthie man <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> did. That this art is moſt honourable and worthy, for that it doth intend to kéepe mans bodie in health, and to remoue ſickneſſe. Therefore it is ſaid, that the end of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgia,</hi> is the reſtoring of mans health.</p>
               <p>Now let vs conſider whether this art be like vnto other
<pb facs="tcp:18258:42"/> artes, or not. In ſome thinges wée ſaie, it is like vnto other arts, and in ſome things it is not. It is like vnto other arts, in that it doth conſiſt in a multitude of principles, whoſe affectes are rightlie to bring to paſſe or finiſh ſome thing which we intend to doe, for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his .6. <hi>Ethic. cap.</hi> 4. doth define Art to be a certaine order of doing, placed with habit and vnderſtanding, working vppon ſome ſubiect, to bring to paſſe and finiſh ſome thing that he doth intend, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame art, ſo that what thing ſo euer is brought to paſſe or done, it muſt néeds be done by ſome one art. In this the art of medicine is like vnto all other artes, for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in doing and bringing to paſſe, or as we may tearme it, in reſtoring health, or curing mans bodie, being ſubiect therevnto. But other waies it doth differ, and doth require a further knowledge than the common Artiſt doth. It is requiſite that this Artiſt which intendeth to vſe the arte of Medicine, ſhould be verie well learned in the ſpeculatiue part of his arte, as well as in practiſe. It is vnpoſſible to carrie in minde ſo many conſiderations, ſo many obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo many inuentions as this art doth require, and therefore it is requiſite, that he be not onelie well learned in the principles of his arte, but alſo that he be ſtudious in the workes of other excellent men, wherein he may learne their wittie and ingenious deuiſes, to helpe this Artiſt the ſooner to bring to paſſe his deſired end. In this it doth much differ from other artes, which worketh onlie by experience, in wittie bringing of things to paſſe, without anie further conſideration, neither doe they néed anie ſuch excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for that theirs doth conſiſt chieflie vppon experience and practiſe, and hath not ſo much regard vnto the life and health of man. For this art doth onelie intend to ſaue mans life in the time of neceſſitie, &amp; alſo to remooue awaie ſuch grieuous ſickneſſes as might anoie and diſquiet both bodie and minde. Wherefore this Artiſt is chieflie to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and looked vnto, not onelie to be rewarded for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent cunning in reſtoring mannes bodie to health, but to bée ſeene vnto and throughlie examined, whether he bée learned in this arte or not, if he be not learned, neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18258:42"/> the principles of this arte, then he is to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden this art for the worthineſſe thereof, for this worthy art worketh vpon mans bodie, for whome all this worlde was made, and all things therin contained, and the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Lord had ſo great care for man, that he did not onelie make theſe things for him, but alſo made him Lord of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and gaue vnto him ſtraight lawes, that he ſhoulde foreſée, that one man ſhould not kill and deſtroie another, neither wilfullie, neither yet willinglie.</p>
               <p>Then I muſt conclude, that whoſoeuer doth take vpon him to miniſter in this art, for the ſafegard of mannes life, and being ignorant in the principles thereof, as I haue ſaid before, he taking vppon him, and the man periſhing in his handes through his default, I ſaie, this is murther, and this is not the right end that art requireth, neither is it ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the common wealth. And therefore it was not in vaine that this worthie man <hi>Guido</hi> did ſaie, that a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion ought to be learned, not onelie in the principles of Chyrurgerie, but alſo in the principles of Phiſicke, yea, and alſo in thinges both naturall and not naturall, and things againſt nature, without the knowledge of which, he ſhould neither rightlie worke, neither yet bring to a good end, the deſired ſcope which is required of the Artiſt. Thus you may perceiue, for this firſt propertie which <hi>Guido</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, where he requireth that a Chirurgion ſhoulde bée learned, it is euen ſo neceſſarie for him, as the head is for the bodie, cut off the head, and ſée what the bodie can doe, although the bodie hath handes and féete, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie members, yet becauſe it lacketh knowledge and the vſe of reaſon, which was contained in the head, and ſhould haue bene diſtributed to the reſt of the bodie, to moue the ſame, and cauſed it to haue done the actions of the minde, thorough default héereof nothing might bée done: Euen in lyke manner, the Chyrurgion lacking knowledge of the principles of this Arte, canne doe nothing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie nor profitablie, but hée ſhall alwayes bée in daunger, eyther to kill or elſe to mayme ſome man, for that hee lacketh that reaſonable and methodicall knowledge which
<pb facs="tcp:18258:43"/> this art doth require, being the head and principle thereof. It is not vnknowen vnto you what manner of ſeruice the Chyrurgion doth ſerue in, &amp; in what places, at what times, and how neceſſarie it is in the common wealth: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though other men haue written verie well héereof, and that I doe not doubt, but that you haue verie wel conſidered the ſame: yet foraſmuch as this moſt excellent ſeruice is not to be neglected, or a light account to be made thereof: I haue thought it good, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it pertaineth to my matter, ſome thing to giue you warning therin. I haue declared vnto you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of this proime, the nobleneſſe of this Art, &amp; how it is to be honored amongſt men, for that it procéeded from the almightie Lord God, and was vſed and ſet forth by moſt noble and worthie Princes, and many other worthie men of moſt excellent vertue and learning. And now at this day either through negligence of the vncarefull Magiſtrates, or elſe through our euill natures, it is vſed by a ſort of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned perſons, to the great ouerthrow &amp; diſhonor of this worthie Arte, yea, and almoſt to the vtter loſſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall and true knowledge therein: which may bée no ſmall daunger héereafter, except ſpéedie remedie be had héerein, and that noble perſons be carefull for this ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie an Art, which kings in times paſt did not onelie giue great rewards vnto thoſe learned men which ſet it foorth, but alſo they themſelues did vſe it, by meanes whereof, they got vnto themſelues immortall fame, in that they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer their people by vſing of this art, from ſo many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous diſeaſes, which dailie they were brought to death withall. Thus theſe gratious and mercifull Princes, were not vncarefull for their ſubiectes, and they did not onelie build certaine Schooles, that this Arte might bée taught in, but alſo they did deuiſe medicines, and miniſtred the ſame vnto thoſe that had néede, in ſuch good order, and with ſuch knowledge, that manye thouſands were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their health thereby, and by their examples they encouraged manie other noble perſons, and alſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent learned men, and men of excellent wit, to ſtudie and practiſe the ſame, to the great comfort of their common
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18258:43"/> welth, and rewarded them with great rewards. But now alas, in this vnhappie time of ours, this Art is not onely neglected, and vnprouided for, but alſo deſpiſed, abhorred, &amp; euill ſpoken of, by meanes whereof noble perſons, and men of great learning, doth rather hate it, then ſéeke meanes or other wayes, to reuiue it againe. For I ſaye once againe, in this our vnhappy time: that Taylours, Shoemakers, Cookes, and Carpinters, are had in more eſtimation, then theſe noble Artiſts bée.</p>
               <p>Yea, I thinke, Iuglers, Players, yea, &amp; Iacke foole with his fooles coate, ſhalbe as well eſtéemed &amp; placed in as néere roomes vnto the magiſtrates, as theſe moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t artiſtes ſhalbe.</p>
               <p>Well, I will ſay no more, but if that noble man <hi>Galen,</hi> were aliue, who doth ſay in his firſt booke <hi>de methodo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi,</hi> that drunkards and riotous perſons, were more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men of knowledge and learning, and alſo how that Cookes, Carpenters, Smithes, and many other occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did runne from their Artes, and tooke vpon them the arte of medicine, I thinke if he were now liuing, and in our Countrey, he would not a little meruaille, to ſée what a diſordred company there is now at this day, which vſeth this Arte: vſeth this Art, nay, abuſeth this Arte, moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and vngodly, to the great diſhonor of our countrey, &amp; to the deſtruction and infamy of this worthie Arte. What ſhall I ſay, that theſe people be ſuffered, nay, rather main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in this vnhappie miſchiefe. For I haue knowen, not onely noble perſons to maintaine them, who haue written their letters in their defence, to kéepe them from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they haue committed moſt wicked déedes, but alſo cauſed a lawe to be made, that euery one might occupy this Arte, without any puniſhment, not onely Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and Tailers, Carpinters, and Tinkers, and ſuch other as <hi>Galen</hi> doth vtterly condempne, and ſpeake againſt: but alſo witches, and baudes, coniurers, and a ſort of falſe ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers. I will not ſpeake of a multitude of ſtrangers, as pouch makers, and pedlers, with glaſſe makers, and coblers, which runne out of their owne countries, and here become
<pb facs="tcp:18258:44"/> noble Phiſitions and Chirurgions, ſuch as now is moſt in eſtimation, and ruleth all the roaſt in our Countrie, ſo that the poore Engliſh men, and ſuch as haue ſerued in the time of warres, with expenſes of their goods, and loſſe of their liues, yea, and the reſt of them that be liuing, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſerue at all times both by land and by ſea, as well in the time of warres as in the time of peſtilence: Theſe poore men I ſaie, are conſtrained to ſerue, to their vtter vndoing, and when they come home againe, they, their wiues, and their children, may goe picke muſcles, for this iollie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie afore ſpoken off, haue taken vp all their acquaintance whileſt they be ſeruing in the warres.</p>
               <p>Come to anie of theſe ſtraungers, or anie of theſe other people, when the Prince ſhould be ſerued, and one will ſay, I am a Tailour, another will ſaie, I am a Shooemaker, and the other will ſaie, I am a woman, ſo that then they will make delaies, by meanes whereof they will not ſerue. And thus the Prince and the common wealth in the time of neceſſitie, is vtterlie vnſerued, for this Companie is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take the liuing of Chirurgions, and the names too, ſo long as there is no néed of ſeruice for the Prince, but then they haue new names, and if they be ſtraungers, they will then trudge home againe into their owne Countries, or els hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the waie, or elſe retaine to ſome noble man, by meanes whereof, they will be defended from ſeruice of the Prince. And thus with this manner of diſordered ſhifts, the Princes with their people, are not onelie euill ſerued, and ſomtimes not ſerued at all, but the noble arte of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie is vtterlie ouerthrowen and brought to ruine, and the true profeſſors therof at this daie, be ſo few in number, that it is to be wondered at. I haue my ſelfe in the time of king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, helpe to furniſh out of <hi>London</hi> in one yéere, which ſerued by ſea and by land, thrée ſcore and twelue Chirurgions, which were good worke men, and wel able to ſerue, and all Engliſh men. At this preſent daie there are not foure and thirtie of all the whole companie of Engliſh men, &amp; yet the moſt part of them be in noble mens ſeruice, ſo that if we ſhould haue néede, I doe not knowe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18258:44"/> where to finde twelue ſufficient men. What do I ſaie? ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient men: Nay, I would there were ten amongſt all the companie, worthie to be called Chirurgions, and let the reſt doe ſuch ſeruice as they may, for if there be néede of ſeruice, I thinke their Chirurgerie ſhall appeare to ſome mannes griefe and paine. Thus I leaue off, and goe to my matter againe. My brethren, you that be Engliſh men, &amp; profeſſe this noble art, remember I ſaie, your vocation, and be not diſcouraged, for that that this rablement doth flouriſh, &amp; that ſtrangers are had in ſuch eſtimation, which I know is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you no ſmall diſcouraging, but I doe not doubt in time, God ſhall ſtirre vp the heart of the Prince, with her Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces noble Magiſtrates, to conſider the great perill that may grow thereof, not onelie in the vtter loſſe of ſo worthie an art, which of neceſſitie muſt néeds be loſt amongeſt vs that be Engliſh men, except prouiſion may bée made, that theſe worthie Artiſtes may haue ſufficient liuing to maintaine them withall, but alſo to foreſee that this common wealth may be ſerued with our naturall, true, and liege Countrie men, and not to preferre Straungers, which commeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hether for their owne gaine, than for anie good loue that they doe beare vnto vs, and in the time of greateſt néede doth forſake vs. Therefore I praie you remember, that ye be verie ſtudious in this arte, and diligent and neate in the practiſing thereof, and alſo to be modeſt, wiſe, and of good manners and behauiour, and that you lacke none of theſe good properties that we haue ſpoken of before, leaſt when you ſhall be called for in the time of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to ſerue Princes, and other noble perſons, ye doe not onelie diſhonour your ſelues and your Countrie, but this worthie art alſo. Remember I praie you what great charge is committed vnto you in the time of warres, ye haue not onelie the charge of mens limmes, but alſo of their liues, which if they ſhould periſh through your defaulte, eyther in neglecting of anie thing that were neceſſarie for theyr health, which you ought to bée furniſhed withall, either elſe through lack of knowledge which ye ought to haue in your art: I ſaie, if theſe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore as you would this art ſhould proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, remoue from it ſuch pernitious occaſions as might be hurtfull therevnto. For if we ſhall be bloudie murtherers, or greedie and couetous catchers, and oppreſſers of poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let vs not looke for the fauour of God, neither yet to proſper in our art, or if we ſhall be negligent in prouiding of ſuch neceſſary things as may be for the help of our diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed patients: either elſe if we ſhall lack knowledge for the right vſe and adminiſtration of the ſame, we ſhall then be ſlaunderous vnto this moſt excellent Arte, and vnworthie profeſſors thereof, and in verie déede, accounted no better than theſe rude runagates and butcherlie Dogleechers are.</p>
               <p>Remember alſo the continuance of your art, as our fore fathers haue done before our time, which hath left no ſmall number of worthie bookes for vs to peruſe, whoſe diligence thereby, for the continuance of this arte, doth moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtlie appeare. And like as they haue with moſt diligent ſtudie, diuine knowledge, &amp; moſt willing hearts, left theſe their workes and labours vnto vs their poſteritie, to be as it were guides, and moſt ſure doctrine to follow: ſo I wold wiſh that we with carefull ſtudie and louing heartes, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their precepts, as louing children ought to followe the profitable commaundementes of their carefull Fathers. And al you that be young men, I requeſt you alſo, that you be diligent in ſéeing of other excellent mens workes, &amp; not to be too bolde &amp; preſume to deale with things aboue your knowledge, but in doubtfull &amp; dangerous matters, to deſire counſaile of the graue and auncient men, who hath more knowledge by long experience, &amp; able to giue better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than you are, by meanes whereof the Patient ſhall not onelie be the better prouided for, but you alſo diſcharged of great blame, which might happen, if anie thing came to the ſicke patient: But well, let your honeſt manners bée equall vnto your excellent knowledge and practiſe in this worthie arte, ſée that ye be faithfull, truſtie, and true, vnto your ſicke patients honeſt of behauiour, ſober of life, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable

               <p>Thus moſt louing Reader, I beſéech thée to ſpare mée thy good word, for my painful trauaile which I haue taken héerein, for the common weath ſake, and for the furtherance of thoſe that be young men of my Companie, and thinke not that I haue done it to teach anie learned man, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to encourage thoſe that be better learned, to beſtowe their diligence and trauaile, either for the amendement of this, or elſe for the ſetting forth of ſome better worke.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y friendlie and welbeloued brethren, when I did conſider with my ſelfe the great defect and imbecilitie which doth remain amongſt our Companie, for lacke of learning in the ſpeculatiue part, of this worthie art of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie, which chieflie doth appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame. And conſidering with my ſelfe what great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and infamie hath growen to our Companie thereby, I haue not bene a little carefull to remoue the ſame thinges from vs. And conſidering with my ſelfe alſo, that theſe things cannot be remoued but by knowledge, and that knowledge cannot come, but by reading and hearing, and reading is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, except it be vnderſtood. Therefore I haue with great diligence collected and gathered together theſe foure bookes of Galen, called Therapeuticon, &amp; being tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Engliſh tongue, I haue dedicated the ſame vnto you, to that end, that you may with the like dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; ſtudie, receiue pleaſure, profit, &amp; great commoditie, by theſe bookes which I heere deliuer vnto you with painfull trauaile, great cares, &amp; charges: But when I did conſider theſe diuine &amp; moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bookes, how profitable &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious the ſame ſhould be vnto you, I ſaie, not onelie to you, but to the whole common wealth of our Countrie, &amp; what great honor ſhuld grow vnto mine owne natural Country men hereby, &amp; alſo what furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; increaſe of knowledge it ſhal be vnto thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this art. I neither regarded monie nor profit, nor paſſed for anie paines, but yeelded my carefull ſtudie to ſerue your turne, in this moſt diuine worke. And moreouer, I thought it my bounden dutie, to helpe to raiſe vp that moſt famous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Galen, who hath lien ſo long buried with that foule monſter Obliuion, from the knowledge of our natural tongue, ſo that worthelie he hath deſerued immortall fame. Now my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, there are three ſpeciall points that are to be conſidered.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18258:46"/> The firſt is, to whom you do miniſter, and to what end your miniſtration ſerueth. The ſecond is, with what thinges you doe miniſter, and what methode you ought to keepe in the time of your miniſtration. The third is, what manner of knowledge ye ought to haue that will cure methodicallie and rightlie, by his miniſtration. To whom this Artiſt doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, it is eaſilie knowen, for he doth miniſter to mans body, which is ſubiect vnto the art of Medicine, and the end and affect of his miniſtration, is to cure mans bodie of ſuch hurts and diſeaſes, as the ſame bodie is anoyed and troubled with. The ſecond doth conſiſt in thoſe things that you cure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and they be three, that is to ſaie, conuenient diet, or as wee may tearme it, conuenient gouernment of the ſicke patient, and conuenient medicaments, apt and meete for the diſeaſe, and alſo an apt and conuenient perſon methodicallie &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to vſe theſe two. The third is, what manner of knowledge this perſon ought to haue. Galen doth verie well deſcribe his knowledge in theſe bookes, againſt that fooliſh bragging Theſalus, how he would take vpon him in ſixe moneths, to make a man perfect in this arte, and yet he himſelfe but a Woolman, or as we may tearme him, a Spinner and carder of wooll, whoſe fooliſh ſtupiditie was ſuch, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with Hyppocrates and Galen, and therfore Galen hath written againſt him in all theſe bookes, not onelie condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, but condemning all other ignorant perſons, which vnderſtand not the principles of this arte, and ſpeciallie other Artiſts, as Carpenters, Smiths, Cookes, Weauers, and women, which doth leaue their owne honeſt occupations, wherein they haue bene brought vp, and dooth arrogantlie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſlie take vpon them this moſt worthie arte, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they be vtterlie ignorant, and if they cure anie thing, it is by chaunce, and not by methode, as you may perceiue in his firſt booke.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another thing to be noted, that Galen doth not make ſuch diuiſions betwixt wounds and vlcers, as wee commonlie doe, for hee dooth name all thoſe that commeth with ſolution, or ſeparation of the skinne. Elkos in Greeke, that is to ſaie, an vlcer.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18258:47"/>
            <p>But if you doe diligentlie conſider Galens method, as in the curation you ſhall finde it moſt excellent, and which is to bee vnderſtoode an vlcer, and which a wound, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now there reſteth no more but your painfull trauaile and ſtudie heerein, and euerie one of you brotherlie and friendlie, to haue conference herein one with another, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the true meaning ſhal be the better vnderſtood, &amp; you your ſelues ſhal receiue it the better into your perpetual memory.</p>
            <p>Thus I take my leaue of you, requiring of you no rewards, but true and faithfull good will, &amp; louing words, with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie furtherance, deſiring the almightie Lord to preſerue and keepe you, and ſend you the knowledge in this worthie Arte, to the profit of the common wealth.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F therefore <hi>Hiero,</hi> the indication which firſt ſpringeth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, doth find out what is to be done, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out remedies, muſt of neceſſitie be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the nature of diſeaſes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. For truly it is againſt all reaſon, that one thing ſhould ſhew the waie of curing, and another that is cured, for each thing can better ſhew of himſelfe, than of another, but this ſhall be made more euident héereafter. And for becauſe all men do graunt the firſt indications to be taken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affects, we ſhall not néede further trauaile héerein, to proue that héereof we muſt take our beginning: nay, rather let vs goe about to ſhew that it is neither the whole, neither any great portion, as the Methodicians doe iudge, but rather the leaſt part, and onely the beginning. Therefore they themſelues doe affirme, that the ſtone in the bladder, (becauſe that it is altogether againſt nature) doth ſhew that it muſt be taken awaie. In like ſort <hi>Acrochordonas, Mirmicias, Atheroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Steatomata, Meliceridas,</hi> and other of like kind. Alſo the inteſtine that is now fallen into the purſe of the teſticles, and all that are diſlocated, becauſe they are in a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, they ſhewe that they muſt be repoſed and put in their naturall ſeate. And all theſe trulie are ſo farre from anie cunning, that they are manifeſt euen to euerie priuate perſon, for they will bidde that the member which they perceiue diſlocated, to be put into the ioynt agayne. Alſo <hi>Achrocordonas</hi> or Warts to be taken awaie, an Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to be brought to a Cicatrize, and a fluxible bellie to bée ſtopped, but by what meanes thoſe thinges may bée done, trulie they doe not knowe. And this is it which ought to bée knowen of the Phiſition: wherefore the indication which is taken of diſeaſes, is onelie the beginning, (and as I may tearme it) the place from whence the waie of curing procéedeth, béeing yet no portion of the arte of Phyſicke, or no great or proper parte, but ſuch a one as is common to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18258:48"/> euerie vulgar perſon: therefore he is worthilie called a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of diſeaſes, that can of himſelfe finde out thoſe thinges, by which may be performed that which is of the firſt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhewed, which if he doe it by experience, then he is to be named, an obſeruer, and an Emperike. But if he doe it by a certaine reaſon and methode, then he is to be called a Logitian, Methoditian, and Dogmatiſt. Now there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Phiſition a vulgar perſon, (I muſt repeate this thing againe) willing him to put the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber into the ioynt, or perhaps to vnite and forme a broken bone, or to haue <hi>Meliceris</hi> taken awaie. But by what waies, anie of theſe things are to be brought to paſſe, that to find out, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the office of the art of Phiſicke. And the Emperikes do boldlie contend, that all things are to be found out by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but we trulie doe affirme, that they are found out partlie by experience, and partlie by reaſon, ſéeing that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experience onelie, neither yet reaſon, can finde out all thinges. Notwithſtanding we think it not good to ſet out a confuſed and mixed doctrine, but Experience by it ſelfe and Reaſon by it ſelfe, that thereby it may eaſilie appeare of what force each of them is.</p>
               <p>And now trulie we haue determined to ſpeake of that inuention which ſpringeth of Reaſon: now therefore haue we anie method following, how we may finde out euerie of the forenamed remedies? I meane to take awaie that which is altogether againſt Nature, and that is diſlocated, to put in his proper place, and to vnite the ſolution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuitie, ſhall we require experience héereto? I trulie am fullie perſwaded, that ther is a method, by which thou maiſt finde out things required, whoſe originall is that, which euerie diſeaſe doth ſhewe to bee done. For the ſolution of vnitie, requireth vnition: and the fracture of the bone, called in Greeke, <hi>Catagma,</hi> in the fleſhie parts, an vlcer: like as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a wound and ruption, called <hi>Regma,</hi> and conuulſion, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Spaſma:</hi> for a wound truelie is a certaine ſolution, lefte in the fleſhie parte of wounding. A ruption and conuulſion, bée ſolutions made without woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:49"/>
               <p>The firſt is diuiſion of the fleſhie partes, the other is of the neruous parts, &amp; all theſe ſhew that there muſt be made vnion, but whether in all it may be performed, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in many, that onelie behooueth the Artiſt to conſider, for no common perſon doth know how that the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> or the ſmal inteſtines, can attain the ſcope, of which they giue indication: alſo he is ignorant that the foreſkin called <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putium,</hi> and the thin part of the chéeks, be of lyke condition. Furthermore, whether <hi>Caries</hi> in the bone (the Gréekes call it <hi>Teridon</hi>) may be cured, like as eroſion in the fleſh, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not. Againe, whether a fracture will grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like as a wound, or doth further require to be adcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated with <hi>Callus,</hi> he perceiueth not whether there is to be hoped the growing of <hi>Callus</hi> in fractures of the head, or elſe is otherwiſe to be cured. Further, he is more ignorant whether there is anie hope of recouerie in wounds of the heart, lungs, ſtomacke, and liuer. And to conclude, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon knoweth anie thing beyond the firſt indication. Therfore the firſt worke of this art is, to conſider whether we may performe that we take in hand, or not, and this is knowen two waies, neither can the third be added or kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. The firſt is, by experience, which requireth long vſe &amp; practiſe: the other is, by the nature of the thing it ſelfe, for this doth ſet out both the ſubſtance of euerie part, and alſo his action, vſe, and ſcituation, with which things procéeding, he ſhall not onelie foreſée what cannot be cured, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate of inuenting remedies for that which maye bée cured.</p>

               <p>THerefore it is manifeſt that we muſt begin of ſimple things, and truelie there is nothing more ſimple than the wound in the vpper part of the fleſh: therefore the cure of this wound, in that it is onelie a wound, is vnition, but if it be with hollowneſſe and putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is a double ſcope, in as much as the effect is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is to ſaie, an vlcer, which is, ſolution of vnitie,

By what meanes haſt thou found theſe medicines? thou anſwereſt by Experience, what is it then that thou haſt added heereto? for euerie perſon doth know, that that which is holow, muſt be filled, but experience hath taught of what things, and by what medicines that ſhould be done: trulie <hi>Theſſalus</hi> knoweth not that medicine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an emperike, neither as a logitian: as an emperike becauſe he will not: as a Logitian, becauſe he cannot: for I trulie doe vnderſtand, that he knoweth this medicine as an Emperike, for ſéeing there are two inſtruments of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie inuention, that is to ſaie, Experience &amp; Reaſon, he which doth know that is inuented, and yet can giue no reaſon thereof, doth ſhew himſelfe to haue found it by experience, therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may vnderſtand how greatlie he hath erred, let him a little giue audience vnto vs, for I will haue to doe in fewe wordes, with the profeſſour of onelie Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for it is méete that he alſo do vtter by what meanes
<pb facs="tcp:18258:50"/> he hath found out this drying medicine that dooth incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which hée nameth <hi>Cephalicin,</hi> and that is compound of <hi>Iris,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> and <hi>Eruus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Olibanum,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that is to ſaie, the droſſe of <hi>Olibanum.</hi> There is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother medicine, which beſides theſe that are rehearſed, hath the rinde of <hi>Panax,</hi> and another medicine to, which is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with waſhed <hi>Cadmia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let him tell me how theſe medicines be found, but what ſkilleth it (ſaith he) to aſke of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> finding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, is it not better to vſe thoſe things that are found out right? And this at the firſt they anſwere, afterward they ſaie, that theſe medicines be found out by dreames, in the meane time by chaunce one medicine was put to another, afterward one was bolde to vſe them mixed, but yet they ſhewe not the ſucceſſe of their boldneſſe. Therefore theſe be manifeſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles. The third waie of inuention, trulie is reaſon, or ſome prouing euerie one of thoſe ſimple medicines ſeparatlie, to be Sarcoticall, afterward beholding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſometime it doth not make fleſh, he findeth out by reaſon, that euerie one of thoſe agréeth not to euerie nature, for vnto whome Ariſtolochia doth not fill the vlcer with fleſh, there Olibanum hath, and where Olibanum hath not profited, there Iris hath done good, for I ſuppoſe that to be reaſonable, that all men are not affected to all things alike. And when this came firſt into reaſoning, it was thought good that many medicines of one kinde ſhould be mixed together, that there might not want a méete medicine for euerie nature. And friend, the action of euerie ſubſtaunce doth not remaine in mixed kindes, ſo that in euerie kinde of bodie, there might be preſent that ſhould helpe the diſeaſe, for if they coulde finde out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bodie, or the force of the Medicine applyed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture there ſhould not néede ſuch varietie in them, in as much as they ſhoulde alwaie readilie finde that one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that ſhould agrée to one bodie.</p>
               <p>Now for as much as they are ignorant in both, they doe crookedlie mixe all together, ſtudying to make one medicine that might agrée to all natures, and I ſuppoſe this reaſon of compounding medicines to be found out of the firſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18258:50"/> and you receiue it as an auncient inuention, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I ſuppoſe that it is not ſo farre from the true medicinall method, as it is reaſonable to be emptied into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, for if they doe not firſt thinke of that method, whoſe compoſition ſtandeth in medicines like of kinde, and not of that which is of contrarie, by and by you ſhall finde in the mixture of theſe medicines, ſome one that may be profitable to the ſicke, and peraduenture not one: contrariwiſe, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or eight which ſhall not néed, ſo that the medicines ſhal more hurt that profit.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges I ſaie, if he doeth not remember, I will account him more ignoraunt than to knowe the thing it ſelfe, for oyle being put into a hollowe wound, is moſt contrarie of all other medicines, for if thou wilt that waie cure, thou ſhalt by vſe finde the vlcer to be filthy and ſtinking, but if the time alſo of the yéere be hotter, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man hath <hi>Cachochimia,</hi> or by nature is apt vnto rumes, or offend in his diet, it is to be feared leaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> part do putrifie, in which the vlcer is made. In like ſort, if thou doeſt vſe waxe either alone, either diſſolued in oyle, for they trulie do make the vlcer putrifie: but if thou doe put in <hi>Aerugo</hi> beaten fine, they ſhall by no meanes putrifie, yet it bringeth great paine and corroſion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it doth eate and prouoke inflammation, and if thou vſe it more largelie, it will alſo make conuulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore ſéeing that neither oyle, nor <hi>Aerugo,</hi> nor wax, can fill an hollow vlcer with fleſh, it is manifeſt that none of thoſe which profeſſeth onelie Experience, will mixe them together, yet I trulie will mixe them, yea, in due waight, not onelie theſe, but a thouſand other medicines, which bée not hurtfull to a hollow vlcer, for if they hurt not with the ſame faculties, but as it were with their contraries, trulie they are vnlike and immoderate to fill an hollowe vlcer: notwithſtanding like as of too immoderate temperatures, there ſhall bée one made temperate, that wée haue ſet out in the waie of compounding medicines: therefore it is not hard to make a medicine of oyle, waxe, and <hi>Aerugo,</hi> that ſhall make fleſh, for if thou doeſt know that the ſame vlcer
<pb facs="tcp:18258:51"/> is moderatlie to be dried, and doeſt not vnderſtand the wax or oyle doth not drie, neither that anie of them, or both mixt together, can fill a hollow vlcer, nor that <hi>Aerugo</hi> alone can moderatlie drie: therefore if thou doeſt mixe all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou maiſt make a medicine which ſhall moderatlie drie, what the quantitie or proportion of euerie one of them ſhould be, that I haue now ſet out in my bookes, which be entituled, the compoſition of medicines, and nowe alſo if it be néedfull, it ſhall be declared in talke héereafter.</p>
               <p>But firſt we muſt driue from theſe our bookes following, this <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> but firſt declaring vnto him, howe much hée hath erred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a truth, for vnto anie that is wiſe, that which is now ſpoken, doth ſufficientlie ſhew what the methode of curing ought to be, but with theſe we néed not talke. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſarie that we diſpute yet with thoſe, taking héere our beginning.</p>
               <p>Euerie hollowneſſe that is againſt nature, doth require to be filled, wherefore alſo that which commeth in the fleſhy part, and that filling in the end, of finding out remedies, which we deſire. And that thou maiſt finde thoſe remedies, which doe fill, thou haſt néede of much reaſon and manifold indication, and exact, reaſonable, and perticular method, for thou haſt often ſéene vlcers harde to cure, not to be cured, neither of thoſe which profeſſe experience, I meane thoſe which abound in remedies, neither of thoſe, which claiming reaſon to themſelues, for theſe <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they name, <hi>Methodicians,</hi> being indeede moſt farre from a methode, as the Aſſe to the Harp, be vnméete to heare this ſpeculation, much leſſe cure, they find out by reaſon, that which is right. Thou haſt ſeene many times in the like vlcers, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes to goe from one medicine to another, when truelie no reaſon did ſhewe them the waie, becauſe they haue tried manye thinges which may fill a hollowe vlcer, the ſame as they call it, <hi>Idioſyncraſian,</hi> that is, properties of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in which euerie of them are ſéene to haue force, neyther can they diſcerne, neyther yet remember. Therefore now alſo, not knowing whether to goe, but truſting in the proofe of many perticulars, whatſoeuer they finde by the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18258:51"/> waie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may profit, they goe from one to another, following Fortune rather than Reaſon, which may help in the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of remedies, like vnto theſe, although they will not be theſe Dogmatiſts, which are not able by reaſon to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the naturall principles of bodies, but of theſe Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions voide of method, what doeſt thou yet ſpeake? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe which cure by right method, doe finde apt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for euerie kinde of vlcers, as alſo conuenient diet, they do moſt apparantlie declare by the things it ſelf, how much it profiteth, and how great light it doth bring to the arte of curing, the Treatiſe of nature it ſelfe declareth: for I haue not once declared vnto you, how that ſometime they which goe from one medicine to another, doe let ſlip and neglect that which is profitable, and that with ſome one of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which they haue vſed, the ſame vlcers haue béene cured, therefore they haue worthilie deſpiſed the facultie of ſuch remedies, which becauſe of the vntimelie vſe, they haue ſéene, not onelie the profite, but much for to hurt, and that in the firſt vſe it hath done no euident thing. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, thou haſt ſéene no leſſe the grieuous pains of the eies to be healed, either with bath, either with drinking of wine, either with foments, either with letting of bloud, eyther with purging, vnto which theſe common ſort of Phiſitions haue applied no other thing, than theſe medicines which are made of Opium, and Mandrake, and Henbane, bringing great daunger vnto the eies, inaſmuch as they taking no other thing awaie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſent but the paines it ſelfe: theſe doe kill the ſence, as thou haſt knowen many, by the vſe of theſe medicines, when they haue bene too much applied, neuer after to haue come to their naturall ſtate, and that firſt their eyes were dim, and they haue hardly ſéene, after to be vexed with ſuffuſion (which is called <hi>Hipochyſis</hi>) or with too greate dilatation of the ball of the Eie, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Mydriaſis,</hi> or with Tabes or Corrugation, called <hi>Rhetioſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou haſt knowen alſo, being with me from ſixtéene yéeres of age, neuer to haue ſeene vnder anie maiſter this worke, but to haue excogitated it by reaſon, and how long
<pb facs="tcp:18258:52"/> time I did conſider that <hi>Aphoriſme,</hi> of vnalayde wine, or bath, or foment, or letting bloud, or purging, taketh away the paines of the eyes. And what truſt I had by the reſt of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> laborers, that there was nothing in this <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſme,</hi> either falſe or might not be brought to paſſe, &amp; that was it which ſtirred mée to ſearch, vntill (going <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> way) I found by what meanes I ſhould diſcerne, when and how, euery of the forenamed ſhould be vſed. By which reaſon I made manifeſt to many, which haue ſéene the like things, of how great force the medicinall methode is, and how great occaſion of euill they are, which haue not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the olde arte of Phiſicke, haue builded new ſectes, and now truely, although from the beginning I haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, yet by entreating, you haue compelled mée to take al this whole worke in hand, which I pray the gods may be profitable, by others truely I haue ſmall hope, aſwell for the contempt of good letters, which now do raigne, as alſo for the admiration of riches, eſtimation and ciuill power, vnto which whoſoeuer doe turne himſelfe, is not able to finde the truth in any thing: But theſe things ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined as pleaſeth the gods, and we now for our power, ſhal reſtore the Methode of curing, which was found of the auncient Phiſitians, being now neglected: repeting againe the diſputation which we haue begunne of the hollow vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and of the firſt inuention of thoſe things, which doth fill an vlcer with fleſh, let that ſuffiſe, which hitherto we haue ſaide, and let vs graunt if they will, vnto the Empericks all that they ſay. And for the vſe of things fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out, I haue often ſhewed to thée in themſelues, and now nothing leſſe, I will go about to demonſtrate by reaſon, how theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericks, cannot by certaine reaſon, go vnto another medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue nothing profited with the firſt, and that rightly chaunceth: for when as they know not the cauſe, of the vnhappie ſucceſſe of the firſt medicine, neither can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the lyke in the ſecond, and when they are ignorant of the cauſe, wherefore the firſt medicine doth not his affect, neither are able to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, why it taketh no place, this thing truely being not knowen, they cannot reaſonably go
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18258:52"/> to another, when as they cannot in the ſame medicine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the like cauſe.</p>

               <p>NOw therfore let vs ſet out <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> waie, and the true method of curing an hollow vlcer, ſurelie it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to begin thus, that is, of the ſubſtance of the thing, therefore ſéeing that an hollow vlcer that is our ſcope, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh which is loſt may be reſtored, it is néedfull to knowe that the thing which engendereth fleſh, is good bloud, nature as I may tearme it, being the workman and author, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is not ſufficient to name ſimplie Nature, vnleſſe we conſider alſo whoſe nature, and where. For it is manifeſt, that Nature it ſelfe is the ingenderer of fleſh, of thoſe bodies that be ſubiect, whereas fleſh is to be made, and ſurelie it is declared, that the nature of euerie bodie doeth conſiſt of the temperament of hot, cold, moiſt, and drie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt, that the iuſt temperament of theſe, in thoſe parts whereas we ſhall reſtore the loſt fleſh, is as it were the workman. And firſt of all, in euerie hollow vlcer, theſe two things are to be conſidered, whether the bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubiect, be in iuſt temperature, that is to ſaie, whether it be according to nature. For we haue declared, that health of ſimiler bodies, is the iuſt temperature of the foure qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and whether the bloud that floweth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part be good, or elſe but indifferent, for if either of theſe doe offend, there are trulie many affects againſt nature, notwithſtanding there is now put to vs but onlie the hollowneſſe in the fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhie parts. Therefore let vs imagine the part to be ſound, and the bloud which floweth to the parte, to be frée from fault, either in qualitie or quantitie, ſurelie theſe thinges béeing, as is ſayde, there is no impediment, but that fleſh ſhall proſperouſlie growe, and that without the helpe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie outwarde medicine, for both cauſes which ingender fleſh, béeing preſent, and nothing outwardlie hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then it cannot bée, but that fleſh muſt bée ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:53"/>
               <p>But in the firſt engendering of fleſh, there muſt of force ſpring a double excrement, as we haue ſhewed in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of Nature, that there followeth euerie mutation of the qualitie of the nouriſhment, an excrement groſe and thicke, and another thin. And theſe excrementes chauncing euer through the whole bodie, that which is thinner, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, by perſperation, notwithſtanding it is forthwith vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as often as the naturall heate diminiſheth, or that hée vſeth more large diet than is méete, or that there happeneth to the creature more vehement motion. The other excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the filth, that is ſent to the ſkin. Furthermore, in vlcers, the thinner excrement is called <hi>Sanies,</hi> in Gréeke <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor,</hi> the groſer is named <hi>Sordes,</hi> and the vlcer is made moiſt by the thinner excrement, in like ſort as by the groſer it is made filthie, and for that cauſe it néedeth two kind of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, that is to ſaie, exicatiues, to expell or drie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is moiſt, and mundificatiues, to purge the filth.</p>
               <p>Now then, ſéeing that nature ceaſeth no time, truelie there can be no time found, in which both theſe excrements may not be gathered together in an hollow vlcer: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ſhall be no time in which thou ſhalt not vſe both kindes of medicines, that is to ſaie, which ſhall exicate and mundifie.</p>
               <p>And now we haue found out of what kinde the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine ought to be, but that is not ſufficient, for it is néedfull to inuent ſome perticular, which is to be applied to the vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. Now by what method, and howe ſhall they be found out? forſooth by the ſame which is ſet out in our bookes, of the faculties of ſimple medicamentes, for we haue ſhewed in them certaine medicines deſiccatiue, certaine humec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, certaine refrigeratiue, and certaine to make hot, yea, and certaine by coniunction, to make hot and drie, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerate and moiſt, or to heate and moiſt, or to refrigerate and drie, and that there is in euerie of them a difference, more or leſſe, but in multitude infinite.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding they be contained within limites to their vſe, which doe eaſilie comprehend them in the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or degrée, or ſecond, or third, or fourth, now of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18258:53"/> ſhall that medicine be, which is méete to enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der fleſh, which muſt both moderately dry, and alſo mundifie? truely of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt degrée, for that medicine, which ſurmounteth this degrée, doth not onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume the abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>daunce of the humor flowing to the part, but doth alſo deuoure the bloud flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, letting the part to be reſtored co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuming the fleſh, or the matter wherof the fleſh groweth: ſurely it is declared that ſuch be <hi>Olibanum,</hi> and the meale of barly, beanes &amp; <hi>Eruum,</hi> and <hi>Iris,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> and <hi>Cadmia,</hi> and <hi>Panax,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philix,</hi> and we haue ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all theſe, differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, more or leſſe, and that ſome of them abound onely in ſimple qualities and other ſome in compound. For <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolochia,</hi> and <hi>Panax,</hi> doe drye more than the reſt, and alſo by nature are more hot, barley and bean flower, doth much leſſe drye than theſe, and haue no heate at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olibanum,</hi> doth moderately heate, but doth leſſe dry tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe, in ſo much as in certaine bodies, it dryeth not at all. The meale of <hi>Eruum,</hi> and <hi>Iris,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> and <hi>Panax,</hi> are in a meane. But now let vs repeate againe, that wée haue profitably touched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olibanum,</hi> in bodies of moiſt nature, is able to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fleſh, but in dry natures he cannot, for it is néedefull to conſider, that there is a two folde difference of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that which is according to nature, ſhewing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of it ſelfe, &amp; further doth alſo require things lyke to it ſelfe, and that which is againſt nature, declaring the taking away of it ſelfe, and alſo requiring things contrary: for euery thing periſheth or is ouercome of his contrary, and in his contrary. And truely the Vlcer, how much it is to moiſt, doth ſo much the more require medicines, which doth drye. But the nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie how much it is more moiſt, ſo much the leſſe it requireth a medicine which doth exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, wherefore if there be any vlcers in which there is like humiditie, becauſe they are in a bodie of dryer te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perament, truely it is requiſite the more to be excicate: that which is in a moiſter temperature, doeth ſo much leſſe néede drye medicines, as there is difference betwéene nature and nature. For it behoueth the fleſh that is engendred, to be
<pb facs="tcp:18258:54"/> like that which was there before. Therefore whereas the fleſh is dryer than in times paſt, it is conuenient that the new be made dryer, ſo that it ought to be the more largely to be dryed, &amp; how much the more it ſhall be drye, ſo much the more ſhall the medicine which ſhalbe applyed, haue a diſſicatiue vertue: but in a moiſt nature, there is ſo much leſſe néede of a medicine diſſicatiue, how much the fleſh is leſſe drye. Therefore like as <hi>Olibanum,</hi> hath ſuch tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the nature of mans bodie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is agréeable to a temperate &amp; meane nature, but it doth ſomewhat more largely drye. Theſe that be moyſter in like ſort, as it is to moiſt for them that be moſt drye, ſo that of right <hi>Olibanum</hi> maketh mattier, both in certaine Vlcers and alſo natures, &amp; doth not engender fleſh, and in certaine it doth engender fleſh. Therefore if thou doſt marke, thou ſhalt finde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe aunſwerable vnto reaſon, for in a moiſter nature it may enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der fleſh, in a dryer it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not. Doeſt thou not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceiue of how many <hi>Theoremes,</hi> or intencions of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he hath néede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will cure an vlcer by a right Methode? for after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is found out, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault is in moiſture, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither it ſheweth foorthwith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther muſt be prepared a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatiue medicine: but for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are of drying medicines, ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dryeth more, and ſome leſſe, that which is expedient muſt be taken, partly of the diuerſitie of the vlcers, &amp; partly of the nature of the ſicke. Therefore he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will rightly cure an vlcer, muſt not onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the nature of the body, but alſo to haue learned, all the ſpeculation of medicines dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and alſo to know the ſignes of bodies, which are of dry or moiſt temperament.</p>
               <p>Now therefore conſider what great raſhneſſe is of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing theſe Methodicians, which think that they haue done ſufficiently to the curing of an hollow Vlcer, if they vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it muſt be filled with fleſh. Truely the way of curing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth not in this, but in finding that out which ſhall fill it with fleſh, but that ſhal fill with fleſh (quod he) is alreadie founde by experience: then confeſſe that which ſhall cure, to be founde out by experience, neither doe they vainely boaſt, neither extoll the Methode, although experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18258:54"/> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, yea, of the Empericks themſelues, which is without certaine limitation: for they write in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of medicines, in this manner. An Emplaiſter for thoſe that haue ſoft bodies, and for children and women, &amp; they know how that <hi>Olibanum</hi> in ſuch natures can engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fleſh, and fill hollow Vlcers, ſo that there be no other accidence: notwithſtanding where ſuch bodies are moiſt, and becauſe of their moyſtneſſe require moderate drying Medicines, or that there is ſome other cauſe of the ſucceſſe, they cannot tell. Againe they ſhall finde an other medicine written for olde folkes, and another againſt thoſe Vlcers which will hardly be brought to a cicatrice, and hath the ſides ſwollen, called in Gréeke <hi>Oxthothe,</hi> and they write in all their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries curatiue, many other ſeperatiues, for which as néere as we can inuent a conuenient medicine, to the propertie of curing nature, for ſeperations in euerie Arte, go about to deuide that which is proper, from that which is common, and how much any doth diuide or parte more thinges, ſo much he commeth néerer vnto the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but the proper thing it ſelfe, cannot exactly be either written or ſpoken: and for this cauſe thoſe Emperickes which were moſt diligent in their Arte, as alſo well néere all the dogmatiſtes, doe acknowledge that there cannot be left in writing any exacte curing, but that which wanteth concerning the coniecture of the nature of the pacient.</p>
               <p>Some of them affirme, that it is to be added or conſidered of the proper vſe of euery Phiſition, other ſome by reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning artificially, but yet none of them was ſo raſh to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that he had one medicine which might engender fleſh, in euery hollow vlcer, for truely thou ſhalt not finde in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours ſuch a Medicine that will cure euery hollow Vlcer, but that the medicine is to be chaunged, according to the humour and temperament of the pacients member.</p>
               <p>Therefore wée leauing here the impudencie of the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicians, goe to, lette vs heare what the Emperickes ſaye, who doe iudge that ſometyme is to be added or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the finding out proper remedies for the pacient, by the proper vſe and exercitation of euery one, for as wée
<pb facs="tcp:18258:55"/> haue after ſayd, there is not in phiſicke any thing, or any remedie, which is not in fine difficil, but in euery thing his qualitie cannot be hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for either it may be ſpoken, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or perceiued. For in an vlcer, moiſture and filthineſſe, may be ſhewed, but the quantitie in neither may be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, although we ſtudying to goe néerer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing it ſelfe, naming it, wée ſay ſmall, and plentifull filthineſſe, or thin and groſſe, or very much or little, and indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent, or elſe calling it otherwiſe in like ſort, whereby we may come néerer, to ſhew the quantitie.</p>
               <p>Now therefore I will haue thée diligent to attend, that thou maiſt know how much it is better, to doe euery thing by a method, rather than by experience only, be it ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that this or that medicine, hath vertue to fill an hollow vlcer, in thoſe whome wée name of moyſter complexion, as an obſeruer or empericke, in thoſe which haue ſoft fleſh, and to women and children, &amp; that he hath not now, any thing profited with ſuch medicine. Therefore wée will ſéeke out the cauſe, why it dyd not profit, and will reduce this, vnto one of theſe two, for either the medicine hath dried to little, or elſe to much, the ſignes of which, be <hi>Sordes,</hi> and <hi>Sanies,</hi> for if there be more <hi>Sordes,</hi> in the vlcer, and that all the vlcer is moiſter, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine hath dried to little, but if it be cleane and without moyſture, it hath dryed to much. Therefore forthwith wée may know the meaſure alſo of the exceſſe &amp; effect, by the manner of the ſignes, and we ſhall afterward make our medicine, which ſhall be applyed, ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more or leſſe drying, but the Empericks truely if any medicine applyed doth not make fleſh to grow, hée verely beholdeth, but yet being ignorant, whether that ſpringeth becauſe his medicine dryeth to little or much, he cannot go vnto another medicine. In like ſort truely, both <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> and <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> being as I haue ſhewed halfe dogmatiſtes, ſhall ill cure an vlcer, for they attempt to cure onely thoſe affects by reaſon, which are proper to the organicke members, but an vlcer as we ſaid, is common both to ſimiler and alſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall parts, therefore ſo farre forth as it is in the ſimiler partes, ſo farre foorth they will cure it <hi>Emperiquelie.</hi>

               <p>Alſo, if they proue to cure thoſe vlcers, whoſe ſubſtance is vtterlie periſhed, or elſe is vnperfect &amp; diminiſhed, in theſe alſo it followeth neceſſarilie, that they maye manifoldlie erre from curing reaſonablie: for if that is loſt by anie ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miler ſubſtaunce, it is neceſſarie that he who will looke to the reſtoring of this againe, be ſkilfull of vniuerſal nature. But of theſe we ſhall héereafter ſpeake, in the meane ſeaſon I ſuppoſe it to be moſt euidentlie ſet out, that euerie one cannot rightlie cure an vlcer, and that the firſt indication, of all which is manifeſt to euery priuate perſon, is the leaſt part of curing.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt now it is time to go to the verie cure of an vlcer, which is alone or ſimple, the vlcer trulie ſhall be alone, if there be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affect or accident preſent, but if the part vlcerate be not moleſted with fluxe, nor viſited with ill iuyce, neither out of his naturall temperature, neither is there anie hollowneſſe, or yet loſſe of ſkin, for this thing a good ſort of Phiſitions do let ſlip, not vnderſtanding howe there remaine two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the part, after the hollow vlcer is filled with fleſh &amp; made plaine, the one being the loſſe of the ſubſtance of the ſkin, the other, of the ſolution of continuitie. Therefore as often as this one thing commeth, that is, ſolution of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie, whether that be of the ouer ſkin, the Gréekes cal it <hi>Epithermia,</hi> or whether it be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſkin called <hi>Thermia,</hi> or it be the affect of the fleſh vnder it, which is called an vlcer, it doth onelie require to be adglutinated, for if the ſides of the ſkin be perfectlie ioyned together, there ſhal be nothing in the middeſt of a contrarie kind, like as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vlcer which is now filled, and is made plaine, for in this the ſides of the vlcer touch not, but the ſkinne of all the exulcerate part is poriſhed, which ought forſooth to be reſtored. But in that wound whereas there is diuiſion made with anie edged toole, there is onelie adglutination required, &amp; not alſo the generation of ſkin. Therefore as often as we purpoſe to finde out the cure of a ſimple vlcer, we in this talke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe that the fleſhie part is diuided, without loſſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie portion of the ſame, for it wanteth a broad ſkin, which we haue called in Gréeke <hi>Epithermia,</hi> which muſt be made by inducing a ciccatrize. Therefore it is neceſſarie both to regenerate this, &amp; alſo to vnite it together, &amp; ſo there be two things vnto which thou muſt looke as in an hollow vlcer, becauſe there is a double affect in both. But peraduenture ſome of them will ſaie, how is a plaine vlcer knowen from an hollow? if there be both a double affect in either, &amp; alſo a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18258:56"/> double ſcope of curing appointed, that is to ſaie, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the loſt parts, where in an hollow vlcer, not onelie the ouer ſkin is periſhed, but alſo the ſkin it ſelfe, yea, and ſometime no ſmall portion of the fleſh. In an vlcer filled, there wanteth not fleſh, but yet outwardlie there lacketh his couering, but we will ſhew héereafter what the cure is of thoſe kindes of vlcers, now let vs vnderſtand what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> due cure of an vlcer, in that it is onelie an vlcer, &amp; hath no other affect ioyned with it, therefore for that héere is onelie diuiſion put forth, it behoueth to ioyne the ſides that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and not onelie to ioyne them, but to make them alſo to indure ſurelie, they which are ioyned ſhall remaine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether two waies, when as ſome of themſelues doth ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, other by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helpe of other things, of themſelues they onelie remaine, which doth grow together and cloſe by the helpe of other, thoſe which are gathered together, and ſo hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with anie glutenous thing, but thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grow together muſt of force be naturallie ſoft. Trulie ſuch is both the fleſh it ſelfe, and alſo whatſoeuer commeth of fleſh, but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are hard &amp; drie, their parts cannot grow together, but doth require ſome glue or band, whereby the ſides ioyned may ſo remaine. But the cure of ſuch bodies ſhal be ſet out héereafter. Héere let vs procéede with our talke begun, of thoſe which may be vnited, ſcarching out alſo the cauſe of ioyning &amp; cloſing, for like as in hollow vlcers there muſt be fleſh ingendred, ſo in a ſimple vlcer that the ſides may cloſe. And nature trulie is the cauſe, that if thou doſt exactly put together the ſides which are ſeparated, they wil cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without anie outward labour, and now there ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another ſcope for thee, to conſider the bringing of the ſides together, beginning with which thou ſhalt finde out, with what thou ſhalt bring this to paſſe, for thou ſhalt cloſe them together which are ſeparated, either with a rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, with two ends put about, or with ſtitching, or hookes, which the Gréekes call <hi>Agkleras,</hi> or with ſome of theſe, or elſe all, it is neceſſarie that the roller which is put about bée not too ſofte, or will bée broken lyke <hi>Alga,</hi> (the Gréeke writers doe call it <hi>Vrouothes,</hi> that it maye
<pb facs="tcp:18258:57"/> ſafelie holde, neither yet ſo hard, that in compreſſing it may offend, then let not thy rolling or binding be ſo looſe, that it cannot doe good, neither yet ſo ſtraight, that by compreſſing it may cauſe dolour. Theſe thinges if thou ſhalt obſerue, without doubt the vlcer will cloſe, if that it bée frée from all iuyce or fluxe, or intemperatneſſe, or inflamation, or anie other fault. But if for the greatneſſe it cannot be that the partes diuided may from the bottome bée exactlie ioyned, neither being able with ſtitching, neither with ſplents, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with rolling to come vnto them, or that there is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> nowe gathered there, or ſome dolour annexed, ſuch an vlcer cannot cloſe together by the onelie ioyning of the ſides, when as that that is pained, cauſeth ſomewhat to flowe more, yea, and although that which floweth bée ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, yet the ſtrength of the parte which are méekned, both for the dolour and paine, and alſo thorough the wound, cannot beare that which is iuſt, but are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, as though it were the contrarie, and héereof ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſuperfluous <hi>Sanies,</hi> yea, and it is meruaile if there followeth not inflamation alſo, if there be <hi>Sanies</hi> collected in the middeſt of the ſides of the vlcer, without paine, or that there bée anie meane place betwixt, which is voide of <hi>Sani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> but yet is filled with the aire, the Vlcer cannot bée ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated by cloſing together the partes diuided, when as the <hi>Sanies</hi> do deuour the vnion, and the voide places which are betwixt the partes to be ioyned, doe let the frontes of the inward ſides to touch. Therefore at the leaſt that thoſe partes of the vlcer maye cloſe, they require Natures helpe to bée filled with fleſh, and ſurelie theſe are ſo little, if the ſides of the vlcer bée rightlie ioyned, that it may be done in one daie, or in two at the moſt. Therefore for this time it behooueth to vſe ſome deſiccatiue medicine, which may drie the part, that it may conſume the <hi>Sanies,</hi> if anie there bée, or if anie ſhall flowe into the voide places, to kéepe it back. Now therfore thou ſhalt cauſe me to call to remembrance y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine which doth incarnate &amp; moderatlie drie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may knowe whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glutinatiue medicine ought to be drier or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

But truelie a glutinatine medicine either néedeth not at all the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fleſh, or elſe verie little. Wherefore it behooueth it to be more deſiccatiue than that which muſt incarnate, ſo that by this reaſon, there is but a ſmall difference betwixt theſe medicines, but yet by another reaſon ther is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in as much as that which doth incarnat, ought eft-ſoones alſo to haue a vertue abſterſiue, whereby it may not onlie dry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abundance of moiſture, but alſo may take away all the filth: Aglutinatiue trulie neither may mundifie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purge, but to bring all the whole ſubſtaunce together. And medicines which be called Abſterſiue and aſtringent, hath ſuch facultie, for theſe ſurelie haue facultie to conſtrain and ſtop, and not to mundifie and purge whereof it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that when we ſtudie to incarnate, we muſt chiefly flie an aſtringent medicine, becauſe it fixeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> filth more ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie than may eaſilie be looſed. Therefore wine is the beſt medicine for euery vlcer, in that it is an vlcer, and if it be not added that it is an vlcer, I ſuppoſe thou wilt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>For it is onelie added for remembrance ſake, leaſt anie ſhould thinke, not as defining anie thing neceſſarie, ſo that if thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe mindfull of all thoſe things, which in the former booke are ſet out, of naming euerie thing, and alſo of the ſubiects, there is no cauſe that hence forth I ſhal define ſuch things vnto thée, it ſhal be abundantlie for me, if I onelie in euerie of them ſeparate the ſimple effects from thoſe that are compound, of which things I haue ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before ſpoken, and nowe neuertheleſſe ſhall ſpeake, not ſo much trulie for the things it ſelf, as that many Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions deceiued by the word, thinke hollowe and vnequall, new and old, filthie, and cleane with inflamation and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inflamation, to be differences of vlcers.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is neceſſarie to make diſtinction, which bée the proper differences of Vlcers, and which be complec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of other affects, but of this a little héereafter. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the wonted doctrine of the olde Phyſitions which I
<pb facs="tcp:18258:58"/> would were now in vſe, is altogether natural, for they ſhew the cure of euerie ſimple effect, but of them all, that doeth chieflie <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> for the curatiue methode ſhall beſt procéede, if we ſhall ſpeake ſeuerallie of euerie ſimple by themſelues, &amp; after ſhew another method of all compounds, as if there were two diſeaſes in the order of diet, retaining and flowing, as <hi>Theſſalus</hi> ſuppoſeth, when as we had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the cure of either of them ſeuerallie, we muſt doe in like ſort of theſe both ioyned together. So in like ſort I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe there is one kinde of all vlcers, in that they are vlcers, and alſo one other kinde of inflamations, in that they are inflamations, it behooueth to ſet out the cure of an vlcer by it ſelfe, and the cure of an inflamation by it ſelfe, &amp; after to ioyne both cures together, which thing if we ſhall doe, truelie we ſhall finde by the methode declared, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vlcer ought to be dried and bound, but yet not mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the hollowneſſe in the fleſh alſo to bée dryed and mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, but yet not to bée aſtringed.</p>
               <p>Alſo after the ſame manner which wée ſpake of in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Vlcers, wee ſhall for the portion iudge Nature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bée ſofte and looſe, or harde and drie, and impact, for the firſt, how much moyſter it is, ſo much leſſe néed it hath of deſiccatiues, the laſt howe much drier it is, ſo much the more it requireth vehement deſiccatiues, and medicines aſtringent, the emperike I ſuppoſe, will héere make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of children, and women, and delicate bodies, and will account young folkes Plowmen and Marriners, of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſorte, but ſéeing that he vnderſtandeth not that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine doth profite children and women, though the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of their complection and another, agréeth in lyke ſorte, with Plowmen and Marriners, becauſe of their drie temperament, neither can he geſſe exactlie the cure of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bodie, neither yet finde out the cauſe of errour, whereby it dooth come to paſſe, that he knoweth not how to goe to an apter medicine, when that which he firſt knewe by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth little profit.</p>
               <p>And thus we haue brieflie ſpoken of glutinatiue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and héere followeth another method pertaining to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18258:58"/> preparation and compoſition of them, for by and by wée ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie to an hollow vlcer what we liſt, whether it be a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine drie or moiſt, for we may ſtrow it in euerie part of the vlcer, or elſe annoint it, but in woundes we cannot ſo doe, where there is a greate déepneſſe, for as ſoone as thou haſt ioyned the ſides of the wound, thou canſt not touch the parts which are in the bottome diuided. Therfore it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether the medicine be moderatly drie and aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but alſo whether it may come to the bottome. <hi>Ceruſſa</hi> and <hi>Litharge</hi> be moderate drying and aſtringent, but if thou doeſt ſtrowe it vppon the wound like as aſhes, thou ſhalt not profite, for the vertue of the medicine that is ſo drie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to the profunditie, therefore there is requyred ſome moiſtures, or elſe of ſome moiſture medicine, that it may be plaiſter like, but theſe belongeth properlie to that ſpeculation, which ſheweth the compoſition of medicines, and not to that which ſheweth the reaſon of curing.

Of this ſort, was hollowneſſe, of which we haue alreadie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. Therefore like as that wée call an hollow vlcer, is not one affect, but that the hollowneſſe and vlcer are two, ſo the vlcer that hath ſupercreſcent fleſh, is not one diſeaſe, but the ſupercreſcent fleſh and the vlcer be two, the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which is againſt nature, ſheweth the firſt indication, which we haue named the waye of finding out remedies, that is to ſay, the taking away of that which aboundeth, &amp; this is perfourmed by the onely helpe of medicines, and not
<pb facs="tcp:18258:60"/> by natures diligence, for it is contrarywiſe that it was in engendring fleſh, and adglutination, for they be iudged na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures worke, we onely remouing by medicines applyed, thoſe things which doe hinder hir, but the taking away of ſupercreſcent fleſhe, is no worke of nature, but is done by medicines, which doe vehemently dry: ſurely thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are next to thoſe which doe vehemently mundifie, and alſo to thoſe that doe ciccatriſe, in ſo much that through er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, many take that medicine which taketh away fleſh, for that which doth mundifie, or for that which doth cicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſe. And that wée go not from our example, if thou doeſt apply to a moiſt nature <hi>Miſi</hi> &amp; <hi>Chalcitis,</hi> thou ſhalt finde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it will rather take away fleſh than ciccatriſe. Wherefore, if we in the want of other medicines, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to vſe theſe, in making a ciccatriſe, putting but onely the point of our probe in it, being beaten into moſt exact lightneſſe, in after applying to the partes which require to be ciccatriſed, as it were in moſt fine flower. But if we inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to diminiſh that which ouergroweth, then we put it in more largely, truely <hi>Aerugo,</hi> can take away fleſh more than theſe, in ſo much as it paſſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of ciccatriſing medicines, but if thou doeſt burne them, like as they ſhall be leſſe ſharpe, ſo ſhall they be found more apt to make a ciccatriſe, but if thou doeſt alſo waſh them, they ſhall be yet more gentle. Thou reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breſt one I thinke, which without reaſon did cure a filthie vlcer, with that notable gréene medicine, mixing Honey with it, after many dayes paſt, he finding the vlcer as filthie as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he voyde of knowledge, neither vnderſtanding what to doe, for it chaunced that the filth was not purged, but alſo ſome part of the fleſhe vnder it, was diminiſhed and diſſolued, becauſe the medicine was to vehement, (like an egregious Phiſition) he added more Honney continually to the medicine, whereby it might more vehemently mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie, as though the medicine before applyed, had not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly done it.

               <p>In the like diſcourſe of our talke, it is euident that both the nature of the Patient is to be conſidered, and alſo that there is a proper curation for euerie man, and yet further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the third thing, that is to ſaie, becauſe there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable propertie of euerie nature, neither comprehenſible by the moſt exact knowledge, he is the beſt Phiſition of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie perticular patient, which hath gotten the method, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may diſcerne natures, and alſo coniecture which are the proper remedies of euerie one. For it is an extreame madneſſe, to iudge that there is a common curation of all men, as theſe moſt fooliſh <hi>Theſſalians</hi> doe thinke, and for that cauſe they ſuppoſe, that all the Theoremes of Phiſick are ordained, that is, they are ſuch as ſkilfull men doe and performe, a farre knowledge of themſelues, and that the art is a certaine knowledge of communities, and not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as though they ſhould cure a vniuerſall and not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, therefore lyke as in all other, euen at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they erre, ſo they erre alſo in this, for the generall or common man is not cured, but euerie one of vs hauing another complection and nature. But theſe truelie thinke ther is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cure of al men, I trulie iudge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, for if I knew how to find out exactly euerie priuate nature, I would think my ſelf to be ſuch a one, as I conceiue in my minde, was <hi>Aeſculapius.</hi>

               <p>But foraſmuch as that is impoſſible, ſurelie I will goe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18258:61"/> as man maye doe, and I haue decréed to exerciſe my ſelfe, and doe alſo exhort others to doe the ſame, and the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes as much as they can, to learne thoſe things that are common, ſo to draw néere to thoſe that are proper, but yet how much they are wyde from the perfection of the thing, it is before ſpoken. For theſe notes for children or women, or olde folkes, or thoſe that haue ſoft fleſhe, and white, and ſuch lyke, are not to be put as they think, for ſure differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but rather how the bodie is affected, in moyſtures and dryneſſe, and it is conuenient as much as may, to allow the Emperick Phiſitions both for many other things, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for that they go as néere as they can, to the propertie of the ſicke. For after all their other ſeparations, which they make, they adde alſo that which is taken of cuſtome, as though hereby they ſhall finde remedies, which are more proper for the pacient. But we will ſpeake hereafter more largely of cuſtome, when we ſhall proue the difference of cuſtome, inuented by the olde writers, for the knowledge of the propertie of the pacients nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe with the reſt, the Empericks receiue, and alſo do confeſſe, that the Phiſition which viſiteth the pacient, ſhall better cure him, than he who hath not ſéene the ſicke. Yet for all that, when as they haue added all theſe things, they will not as yet, ſaye that they haue a ſound and ſkilfull knowledge, of the proper curation of the pacient. But that moſt impudent <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> onely vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vlcer muſt be filled, affirmeth the <hi>Theoremes</hi> of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to be conſtant and firme, although as before is ſaide, all men know at the leaſt this thing, not onely they which now be after this <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> as another <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> was borne, but I ſuppoſe alſo thoſe that were before <hi>Deucalion,</hi> and <hi>Phoroneus,</hi> if theſe were reaſonable, and beſides, if they knew how a hollow vlcer is to be filled with fleſh.

For that another medicine hath profited other, very children doe now well néere vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and reaſon which is grounded on the Elements, doth alſo confirme the ſame. For if thou doeſt make xv. differences in the complexions of men, by reaſon of exceſſe and defect, and that onely in moyſt nature, truely it ſhall alſo be neceſſarie that thou knoweſt xv. differences of medicines, which thou wilt vſe, of which ſome drye more, and ſome leſſe, whereby thou maiſt finde that agréeth to euery nature, and if alſo in drye complexions there be put other xv. differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and thou require other xv. medicines alſo to theſe, thou ſhalt haue in all .xxx. medicines, which ſhall agrée to xxx. natures, which onely he can rightly vſe, which hath diligently exerciſed himſelfe in the temperaments of bodies.

               <p>Alſo whether is it here euident that what parte hath a dryer temperament, requireth dryer medicines, that which is more moiſt, leſſe deſiccatiues.

And to be briefe, wheras there are many cartilages, &amp; cotes, &amp; ligaments, &amp; bones, &amp; nerues, for héere is no fat or fleſh, or but verie little, the indication within theſe is héere taken of the nature of the part, is contrarie to that which is taken of the nature of the whole bodie, wherfore if ſo be that howe much the complection of the Patient is more moiſt than is requiſite, ſo much the parte affected is more drie, we ſhal neither adde, neither yet ſubtract from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, but we muſt vſe ſuch a medicine as we wold apply to the vlcer, made in the parte of meane temperature, and where the bodie is moderatlie temperate, but if the part be ſo much the more drie than is requiſite, as the temperame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the bodie is moiſter, we muſt ſo much increaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drineſſe of the medicine, or the temperament of the part, excéede the temperament of the whole, as if the exulcerate part excéed in drineſſe foure parts the iuſt temperatneſſe, &amp; that the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents nature is thrée degrées moiſter, it is manifeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the part which is nowe vlcerate, requireth a medicine one degrée drier, than where as the part is temperate, it is euident y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all theſe are taken by coniecture, and that he ſhal beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, which is exerciſed in reaſoning of theſe, &amp; trulie in all ſuch there are together at one time contrarie indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, neither ſhall I néed to ſpeake alſo of thoſe indications, which are taken of hot &amp; colde, becauſe they may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is ſpoken. Trulie in other, the indications are ſeparated by times, in which there are finiſhed, &amp; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth alſo chieflie in the beginning of the curation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one to ceaſe, &amp; the other to doe his part, example, if an vlcer bée with hollowneſſe &amp; verie filthie, there is a thrée fold affect, againſt nature, the vlcer, the hollowneſſe, &amp; the filth, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of curing in purging the filth, becauſe the vlcer cannot be anie thing adglutinated or filled with fleſh before it be cleane, the cure of the hollowneſſe hath the ſecond place, for if we ſhal either adglutinate or incarnate, or to ſpeak brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18258:64"/> cure the vlcer, we cannot fill the hollowneſſe: imagine therefore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not onely theſe thrée do infect the part, but alſo inflamation or Eriſipelas, or Gangrena, or ſome intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratiues, either ſimple or compound, whether or no it is manifeſt, that the vlcer cannot be filled with fleſh, before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this be taken awaie, it is before ſaide, that generation of fleſh commeth of that which is ſound vnder, but new fleſh cannot grow, of that which inflamation infeſteth, &amp; is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, &amp; to conclude that which is ſick, therfore there is of them to be conſidered a thrée fold end in all ſuch coniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one as it were taken of the cauſe which is to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, another hath the reaſon, without which not, the third is named ſuch as do inforce and accelerate. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the fleſh, is as it were the cauſe, which maketh that is vlcerate to growe with it, and filleth the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The pureneſſe &amp; cléerneſſe of the vlcer hath the place, without which not, for the filth letteth, this doeth prolong the cure, the hollowneſſe hath the place to the vlcer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which not, for if the hollowneſſe be not filled, the vlcer cannot be cicatriſed, therefore if thou doeſt regard theſe, thou ſhalt finde the order of curing, as if inflamation &amp; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe, &amp; an vlcer, &amp; filth, be found together in the part, we muſt firſt cure the inflammation, ſecondlie the filth, thirdly the hollowneſſe, &amp; laſt the vlcer. And truelie in the rehearſed, both the order and the inuention of things to be done, is taken of theſe, but the indication of that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth or accelerateth, is not héere reckoned, in other truly it is, for that affect is firſt of all to be cured, whereof there firſt followeth perill to the man, yea, &amp; not onely firſt, but onely it, as if the head of a muſcle be prickt, there followeth conuulſion, which cannot be remitted by the helpe of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient medicines, for thou ſhalt heale the conuulſion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being cut ouerthwart, notwithſtanding thou haſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſome motion of the part, in like manner when ther immoderatlie floweth bloud out of a veine or arterie, if thou cutteſt the whole veſſell ouerthwart, although thou canſt not cure the Vlcer, yet thou haſt taken awaye the perill, which ſhould haue come through the fluxe of bloud.
<pb facs="tcp:18258:65"/> Now we are conſtrained after to cut a nerue ouerthwart, as often as we ſée either conuulſions, or madneſſe, or both, being great, and hardlie curable, to follow after wounding. In like ſort, where luxation chaunceth in anie of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ioyntes, we cure the vlcer, but leaue the luxation incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for if we wold cure alſo this, conuulſions would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The third end to put before our eies of curing is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which enforceth &amp; accelerateth, and is contrarie to the other two rehearſed, neither is it all one, to conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing as the cauſe, or as that which hath the place, with out which not, or as that which enforceth and accelerateth. But we haue ſaid, that which enforceth is ſuch ſometime, that it leaueth the other affect vncurable, and alſo that both we make the affect, partly in the pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cture of a nerue or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or profuſion of bloud, of the veſſels, and partlie in the muſcle whoſe head is wounded, for wheras the luxation is with the vlcer, we make not the affect, but leaue onelie that vncured which is made. But we ſhall ſpeake more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of theſe héereafter.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18258:65"/> for if there be diuiſion with anie edged thing, if the forme of that which did wound be imprinted in the part diuided, there ſhal truly be ſo many differences of vlcers, of oblique, right, retort like a briſtle crooked like an hooke, and ſo being euerie waie, and all theſe differences be of the figure. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, there are a thouſand other differences of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for an vlcer both is, and is alſo ſayde to be bigger or leſſer than another, alſo great &amp; little, alſo a ſhort &amp; a long, a ſhallow and a déepe, and in euerie of theſe, both that it is more or leſſe, ſuch a one whether it be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſpace, or magnitude, or quantitie, or call it after what manner you will, but if this ſo be, then trulie an vlcer equall or inequall, ſhall be with the profunditie of diuiſion, for if it chaunce that the thing being cut in length, the higher parte of the diuiſion may go in déeplie, the lower part to be in the vpper part of the bodie, or contrarie, the higher part of the wound to bée in the vpper part, the lower to bée déeper, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo theſe, that is to ſaie, to bee diuulſed in ſome part, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and to haue bene cut, and where that wound went ouerthwart vnder the ſkinne, the one part of the vlcerate parte to be ſéene, the other to be hidden vnder the ſkinne, and that to be in the higher partes or lower, or ſides, all theſe be differences of vlcers. Againe, of the time there are other differences of vlcers taken, as an olde or new vlcer, of ſmall or long time, and in all theſe, the reaſon of more &amp; leſſe is to be numbred. And theſe differences are taken of the nature of the vlcer moſt proper, which are taken of the ſubſtance of the thing, for thoſe that are taken of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and magnitude of diuiſion, and that either in length or déepneſſe, or in both dimenſions, alſo in theſe with equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or inequalitie, theſe that come outwardly, and hath the place of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without which is not, alſo of the time in which the vlcer is made, for ſo one is called a new, another an old vlcer.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18258:66"/> of a muſcle, or beginning of a muſcle, or middeſt of a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or that the ſkinne is vlcerate, or that the vlcer be in the liuer or bellie, they be forſooth differences of vlcers, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the proper nature of them, but of the places in which they are, but when anie ſaith the vlcer is not infected with inflamation, or preſſed with ſupercreſcent fleſh, or hollow, and thinketh that they be like thoſe which lately I rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he muſt of force be deceiued in the curatiue method, for in Gréeke <hi>Phlegmon Elcos,</hi> by the forme of ſpeech hath the like figure of interpretation with a little vlcer, but yet that which is meant thereby is not alike, for déepe and hollowe when we ſpeak of an vlcer, we ſhew theſe proper differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but <hi>Phlegmon</hi> is not at all the difference, when as the part may be infected with inflamation, yea, whereas there is no vlcer, ſo that I thinke it lawfull to chaunge the forme of ſpéech, if thou wilt ſaie, an vlcer with inflamation to haue come to anie man, thou ſhalt goe néerer than to the nature of the thing, and ſhalt interpret it more cléerely, but not if thou ſhalt ſaie, ſome with bigneſſe and ſome with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, to be made, for thou maiſt ſpeake more euidentlie, and after the nature of the thing, if thou ſhalt ſaie he had a great vlcer, and a little, ſo that if it maye be done, that the forme of ſpéech be chaunged, both more conuenient to the nature of the thing, and more manifeſt to the hearers, we ſhall not leaue of, whereby it may leſſe be done, for the waie to flie deceit in things, is that, to vſe defined ſpéech, therefore what methode may we appoint, in ſuch there is to be noted a certain precept, and as it were, a ſcope, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the diligent may eaſilie diſcerne by and by, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſpeaketh of the difference of anie affect, of the ioyning of another affect.</p>
               <p>Therefore let this be to thée a difference, that which may ſeuerallie and by it ſelfe ſtand, that ſhall neuer be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of anie other affect, therefore magnitudge, littlenes, equalitie, inequalitie, time, and figure, be of the number of thoſe which happen to other, but an vlcer, &amp; inflamation, &amp; Gangrena, and corruption, maye ſtande ſeuerallie and by themſelues.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:18258:66"/>
               <p>There are certaine affects of our bodies againſt nature, as chance neceſſarily to affects, for vnto al theſe it followeth neceſſarily y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be either little or great, or equall, or ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, or new, or olde, or they appeare euidently, or they are hid &amp; not ſéene. To be infected with inflamation, is not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſort which happen to an vlcer, as neither to begin to putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, or infected with Gangrena, all thoſe be in the number of diſeaſes, for they are affects againſt nature, &amp; corrupteth the action. Againe, there are other as it were, differences of vlcers ſpoken of, as a tormenting vlcer &amp; a filthie vlcer. But héere alſo is ſome compound ſhewed, but after another ſort than was ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an vlcer infeſted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inflamation or a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vlcer, for héere inflamation and putrefaction be affects, their dolour &amp; filthineſſe be of the kind of accidents: in like condition whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſaie, <hi>Cachochimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vlcus,</hi> that is, an vlcer infeſted with ill iuyce, or an vlcer vexed with ſluxe or coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe is coupled with the affect. And hereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the firſt &amp; ſimple imfirmities void of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition, be as it were the elements of the curatiue method, which is now inſtituted. Wherefore the rather I haue numbred all ſuch infirmities, in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of the differences of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. Trulie all is one, whether thou call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt or ſimple, when that which is firſt is ſimple, &amp; that which is ſimple is firſt, &amp; therfore elementarie. There is an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken of the differences, although not of all, for a new or olde vlcer ſheweth nothing, although ſome thinke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, but theſe deceiue themſelues, not otherwiſe than in the order of diet, where they affirme, that there is one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the beginning, another in the augmentation, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the vigor, &amp; another in the declination, of which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing héereafter I ſhal more largely intreate, ther is no cauſe why héere I ſhould make more words, yet for all this I wil here ad y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhal ſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time preſent. They think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a new vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is frée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie other affect, &amp; hath no accident ioyned with it, doth ſhew another curation than an old vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not ſo, for in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is onelie an vlcer, and no other thing, it is ſuch a one as hath no hollowneſſe, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or filth, and is free from euerie other affect, doth onelie
<pb facs="tcp:18258:67"/> require the cure of an vlcer, whoſe end ſet by vs, is either vnition, or adglutination, or coition, or continuation. For I haue a thouſand times ſaid, that thou maiſt cal it as thou pleaſeſt, ſo that the thing it ſelfe be not chaunged, therefore this kinde of vlcer, whether it be new or olde, requireth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the ſame curation. That difference which is taken of the time ſheweth nothing proper at all. But if the vlcer hath hollowneſſe déeplie hid vnder the ſkinne, it behoueth to conſider whether it be in the higher part, that the matter may readilie flow out, or in the lower part, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is there ſtayed. The cure of that vlcer where ther is no fluxe, is like the cure of other. But it behoueth that we make certaine iſſuing out where there is none, and that is two waies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hollowneſſe being cut in the pendent place, onelie opened, both the nature of the partes, and alſo the bigneſſe of the vlcer ſhal ſhew, when as either of them muſt be done, for if the places themſelues make the cutting dangerous, and the vlcer ſhall be great, it is more conuenient to open in the pendent place, but otherwiſe it is better to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and wheras there is an iſſue, let the rolling be begun aboue, and end beneath. We haue héeretofore ſpoken, that the difference of vlcers which is taken of all the wounded partes, is verie neceſſarie to ſhew the cure, but the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was of ſimiler, this which I now ſpeake of, is as it were of inſtrumentall, trulie we will in the bookes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeake more largelie of that indication, which is as it were of ſimiler bodies, or as of inſtrumental. Now we muſt goe to the proper differences of vlcers, and define of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ouerthwart, or right, or déep, or ſhalow, or little, or elſe great. Vlcers made ouerthwart, for that their lips do gape more, and are aſunder, do require to be more diligently ioyned, &amp; therefore we muſt vſe both ſtitching and hookes. Thoſe that are made in the length of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> muſcle, if thou bind it with a roller of two beginnings, thou ſhalt not néede ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtitching or hookes, but if thou wilt otherwiſe binde it, vſe thou either ſtitching or hookes. Few ſtitches ſhall in this ſuffice. And thou ſhalt cure greate vlcers with vehement deſiccatiue medicines, if thou remembreſt that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18258:67"/> which before is ſpoken. The medicines which doe moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drye, will abundantly heale ſmall vlcers. Déepe vlcers be euer alſo great, therefore they muſt be rolled with two beginnings, and the lippes of it be ſpedely adglutinated, and thoſe which are both verye déepe and alſo long, as they are great two wayes, ſo doe they ſhew a double indication, therefore they require vehement ſiccatiues. Neither ioyne thou the lippes to ſoone together, and rolle it with two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and take déepe ſtitches.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, if there come many differences together, of which euery one hath his indication, it is expedient to vſe them all, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be not contrary. But if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary among themſelues, wée haue heretofore ſhewed how it behoueth them to be denied of theſe, but wée will more largely ſet it out hereafter. And now it ſéemeth good in this place to ende this third booke: In the fourth, which ſhall follow, we will diſpute of thoſe affectes which for the more part accuſtome to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vlcers, and with theſe there ſhall be ſet out the curations of inward cauſes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſaid that there is one kind of diſeaſe that is called ſolution of continuitie, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into all the parts of the bodie of mankind, howbeit it hath not one name in them all. For ſolution of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie in the fleſhie part, is called an vlcer, in the bone a fracture, the Gréekes call it <hi>Catagma,</hi> in the nerue, a conuulſion, the Gréekes call it <hi>Spaſma.</hi> There be of the ſame kindes of Solutions, which the Gréekes call <hi>Apoſpaſma, Regma, &amp; Thlaſma. Thlaſma</hi> in the ligament, <hi>Apoſpaſma &amp; Regma</hi> in the veines and muſcles, becauſe of anie violent ſtroke or grieuous fall, or anie other great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſolution of continuitie, called <hi>Ecchimoſis,</hi> in the Gréeke, commeth moſt often with concuſſion and ruption. Sometime ſolution of continuitie commeth by opening the orifices of the veines, in Gréeke named <hi>Anaſtomaſis.</hi> Alſo it commeth of that which is called of many <hi>Diapediſis.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolutions of continuitie happen of Eroſion, in Gréeke called <hi>Anabroſis.</hi> But it is a diſpoſition alreadie medled and compoſed with an other kinde of diſeaſe that conſiſteth in the quantitie of the partes, as before hath bene ſhewed, when as we did intreate of hollow vlcers, which doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of two cauſes, that is to ſaie, of Exition and Eroſion. It is manifeſtlie knowen by what meanes exition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. And if eroſion abound inwardlie, it commeth of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chochimia,</hi> if outwardlie, it is done either by ſtrong medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine or fire, it behoueth then, as is ſaid before, to take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent héede, and diſcerne the ſimple diſeaſes from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, for to a ſimple diſeaſe, a ſimple remedie is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to a compound diſeaſe, a compound medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
               <p>Alſo we haue ſaid before, what method muſt be kept to cure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diſeaſes, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it is not inough to
<pb facs="tcp:18258:69"/> know the generalitie of the ſaid method, but to be exerciſed in all parts thereof. Séeing then that in the ſame is néede by manner of ſpeaking of ſundrie perticular methods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that euerie kinde of diſeaſe hath his owne methode, then that which reſteth of the curation of vlcers, muſt bée performed in this booke, taking the beginning héere.</p>
               <p>Euerie vlcer is ſimple and alone, without other diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affects with it, or it is with ſome other diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diuerſe, whereof ſome haue not onelie ſtirred vp the ſame vlcer, but hath augmented it. The other are, without which the ſaid vlcer cannot be cured. Of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken héere before, we ſhal ſpeake in this preſent booke of the diſpoſitions which augmenteth the vlcer, in the which lyeth double counſaile of curation, that is to ſaie, either to take the ſaid diſpoſitions all wholie out of the bodie, or to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the incommoditie that aboundeth in it. The which thing may be eaſilie done, if the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be little, but if it be great, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vlcer may not be cured, vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame diſpoſition be taken awaie. Wherefore we muſt diligently conſider, what the ſaid affects and diſpoſitions be, and how many in number, in taking our beginning, as is ſayd before. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vlcer is by it ſelfe alone, or with hollowneſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the fleſh being ſubiect be natural, and that there be nothing betwixt the ioyning of the lips, that may let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conglutination ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which oftentimes happeneth either by haire, a Spiders web, mattier, oyle, or ſuch lyke things, that may let the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together.</p>
               <p>And theſe things are as <hi>Symptomata</hi> and accidents of the ſayd wound, which if they be preſent, maye hinder the curation, but if they be not, they let not, but the diſpoſition of the fleſh, is cauſe of that which followeth. For with the ſame fleſh, and by the ſame, lips that were aſunder are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the hollowneſſe filled.</p>
               <p>It behoueth then that the ſayd fleſh be naturall, becauſe that theſe two things may be wel and commodiouſly made perfect. Then it is naturall if it kéepe his owne tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which thing is common to all other partes, for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth that the fleſh ſubiect be wholie temperate, as well
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18258:69"/> to cloſe the vlcers, as to fill them with fleſh. But is that enough I praie you? Muſt not the bloud that commeth to it be good alſo, and moderate in quantitie? I thinke this trulie to be true. For that bloud which is corrupt, doeth ſo differ from adglutination and filling the fleſh, as alſo ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to exulcerate and erode the bodie. And if it be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much in quantitie, it engendereth excrements in the vlcers (as we haue before ſpoken,) and hindereth the curation. And alſo there be thrée kindes of vlcers which are difficill and hard to be cured. The firſt aboundeth by the vntempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the fleſh, being ſubiect. The ſecond by the vice &amp; ill qualitie of the bloud comming to it. The third, of a great meaſure and quantitie of the ſaid bloud. Ought not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion to be made thus or otherwiſe? That is to ſaie, the cauſe wherefore ſome vlcers are ſtubburne and difficill to be healed is, for the miſtemperance of the fleſh exulcerate, or elſe for the gathering of humors vnto the vlcerate part. Yet againe the miſtemperate fleſh ought to be diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two differences. The firſt is, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh being ſubiect is out of his nature onelie in qualitie. The ſecond is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the euill qualitie it hath tumor againſt nature. The flowing of humours is diuided into two differences, that is to ſaie, into the qualitie and quantitie of humours.</p>
               <p>Sometime diuerſe of the ſaid diſpoſitions are mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſometime all. But the methode for to cure them, ought not to bée giuen all together, but each one by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND if the diſtemperance of the fleſh bée drie, moderate it with bathing and wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in temperate water. But at all times that this remedie ſhall be vſed, the end of the bathing and wetting ſhall be till the particle come ruddie, and riſe in a lumpe. Then ceaſe the bathing and moiſting, for if you bath it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more, you ſhall cloſe the humour againe that was loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:70"/> and ſo you ſhall profit nothing. Likewiſe the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning facultie of medicines ought to be greater than is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed in a whole part. If the fleſh be more moiſt than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall habitude, you muſt haue regard to the contrarie, for the facultie of medicines in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe ought to be deſiccatiue, and to vſe no water. But if thou muſt waſh the vlcer, take wine or <hi>Poſca,</hi> that is to ſaie, <hi>Oxicratum,</hi> or the decoction of ſome ſharpe hearbe.

For ſometimes they confeſſe they feele great heate in the particle, ſometime ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold coldneſſe, and ſo delight themſelues in hot or colde medicines. And ſometime appeareth redneſſe, and ſomtime whiteneſſe. But to diſtinguiſh theſe thinges, it is not the duetie of this our proponed worke, in the which worke we ſhew not the method to know the affectes, but to cure them, in ſuch wiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by conſequence of words, we bée come vnto the ſaid methode, to knowe the affects. Againe let vs returne to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If anie parts are vlcerate with tumour againſt nature, firſt the tumour muſt be cured. What ought to be the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all tumours, we ſhall ſaie héereafter. Preſentlie we ſhall intreate of that which is ioyned vnto vnkind vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. But when the lips of the vlcers are diſcoloured and ſomewhat hard, they muſt be cut vnto the whole fleſh. But if ſuch affect is like to procéed, further deliberation muſt be had, leaſt that which doth ſéeme to be repugnant vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be cut out, or in longer ſpace to be cured, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt in ſuch a caſe it is good to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patients mind. For ſome had rather to be long in curing, than to ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and other are readie to endure all thinges, ſo that they may the ſooner be made whole. Likewiſe héere ſhal be ſpoken of the ill iuyce which floweth to the exulcerate part, and in as much as it is a malignant and a wicked humor, it ſhall be ſpoken of héereafter in his owne place. When as therefore the humour which floweth to the vlcerate parts, is not farre of, nor doth abound in qualitie or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18258:70"/> it ſhall be then conuenient to direct it, and to reſtraine the fluxe which commeth vnto it, and alſo to coole the heate of the parts that be néere the vlcer. Furthermore, you muſt behold the ligature or rolling at the vlcer, and leading it to the whole part, as <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> commandeth in the frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured bones. Alſo that the medicines that are miniſtred to the ſayd vlcers, muſt be more ſtronger than they that are applied to a ſimple vlcer. And if the fluxe of humours wil not ſtaie with conuenient medicines, then you muſt ſéeke further the cauſe of the ſaid fluxe, and take it awaie. If the fluxe come by weakneſſe of the member that receiueth it, the ſayd weakneſſe muſt be cured. And ſuch curations alſo ſhal be proper for the vlcerate part. But if the cauſe of the fluxe be through the abundaunce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud, or of the ill diſpoſition of all the bodie, or of anie of the ſuperiour parts, you muſt firſt take awaie the ſaid cauſes. The weakneſſe of the part, forth of which abundance of iuyce doth flow, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth whole of the intemperancie, &amp; not altogether. Wherof it followeth, that the vlcerate fleſh is only intemperate, and not weake and féeble, &amp; ſometime it chanceth both the one &amp; the other. For the great intemperancie is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becilitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affected part, the which intemperancie is cured as is aforeſaid, in refrigerating the heate, humecting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dry, warming the cold, &amp; deſiccating the moiſt. And if the place be too colde &amp; moiſt together, the medicines muſt be in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; drying together, &amp; ſo of the other intemperances, in putting away euery qualitie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſurmounteth by his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The reaſon is: Euerie thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> behaueth it ſelfe wel, is according to nature, not only in liuing things, but in pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; alſo in al other things ther is an equality, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeks cal <hi>Simmetron,</hi> &amp; without exceſſe of al vicious humors. For the thing where nothing can be taken fro or put to, neither anie part, or anie qualitie, it is all perfect in one equalitie: contrariwiſe, the thing that muſt haue taken fro it, or elſe ſomewhat added to it, is not in a naturall &amp; perfect eſtate. Wherefore it is not poſſible to cure rightlie, but in taking awaie that which is exceſſe, &amp; putting to it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which lacketh. In another place we muſt ſpeake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouermuch or lacke
<pb facs="tcp:18258:71"/> of things, but when anie qualitie is ouer much, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that the other qualitie contrarie to him, ouercome him againe, and the corruption of humors or intemperancie, bée remoued in reſtoring the ſaid qualitie that wanted, for in cooling that which was too hot, thou ſhalt reſtore that which lacketh, &amp; diminiſh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was too much abundant. Thus it is neceſſarie that the curation of the things that are put farre from their naturall habitation, by ſome intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, be made perfect againe by thinges of contrarie vertue. And thus the fleſh or anie part thereof, wherein is fluxe of humours, becauſe of weakneſſe, ought to be made in this manner, (as is ſayd before) and when the intemperancie is cured, then procéede to the cure of the vlcer, firſt curing the intemperancie, as if it had come without the vlcer: By the which thing it is manifeſt, that all ſuch curation is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the vlcer, but to the intemperancie.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe if anie fluxe of humours happen to the vlce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate partes, as wel by the occaſion of anie perticular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as of all the bodie, wherevnto the bloud or anie ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours doe reſort, firſt, remedie muſt be had either to the particle that is cauſe of the fluxe, or elſe to the whole bodie. Thus then we ſhall cure firſt the varices, that are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting vnto the vlcered place, before you cure the vlcer, and then afterward you may the eaſilier cure the vlcer. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in them that haue a diſeaſe in the ſplene, or in anie other notable part, firſt it behoueth to cure the ſayd parte, and then after to procéede to the curation of the vlcer, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit none of the curations héereof is proper to the vlcer, but ſome other affects or diſpoſitions, that either engendereth the vlcer, or that nouriſheth and conſerueth it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt now I thinke it time to define that there is no indicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of outward, or (as they terme it) of primitiue cauſes of curation, but the indication or curation to haue his beginning of the affects it ſelfe. But thoſe thinges that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18258:71"/> ought to be done perticularlie, are found out either of that which the indication ſheweth, either of the nature of the affected part, or of the temperature of the aire, or other like things, but to ſpeake brieflie, no indication may be taken of things that be not yet come. But foraſmuch as we ought to know the affect, that is not manifeſt vnto vs by reaſon or wit, we are often conſtrained to enquire of the extreme and primitiue cauſe. For this occaſion the vulgar people ſuppoſeth, that the ſaide primitiue cauſe is Indication of curation, which is altogether otherwiſe. As it appeareth likewiſe in thoſe, where the affect may be exactlie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. For if <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> or an Vlcer, or Eriſipelas, or putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or Phlegmon, bée in anie parte, it is a ſuperfluous thing to enquire the efficient cauſe of theſe diſeaſes, except they be remaining. For in ſo doing we ſhall cure that thing which is alreadie finiſhed, and ſhall prohibite the efficient cauſe to procéed anie further. But if the ſaid efficient cauſe which produced the effect, hath no longer biding there, then we ſhall remooue awaie the affect. For to put awaie the cauſe that is not there, it were impoſſible. For curation appertaineth to the thing preſent, as prouidence to the thing to come. For that thing which doth not now hurt, neither is to be feared that it will hurt héereafter, is out from both the offices of the arte, that is to ſaie, from curation and prouidence. Wherefore in ſuch thinges there ought to bée no ſearching of anie indication, neither yet to cure, nor to prouide (as is ſayd before) notwithſtanding the knowledge of the primitiue cauſe, is profitable to vs in things vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. Neuertheleſſe the Emperikes take ſometime the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue cauſe as parte of the courſe of the diſeaſe, that the Gréekes call <hi>Sindrome,</hi> wherein they haue obſerued and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curation, as in that that hath bene hurt with a mad dog, or venimous beaſts.</p>
               <p>Thus doth alſo ſome Dogmatiſts, which doth affirme to cure ſuch diſeaſes by experience onelie, without ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Indication, for they take the cauſe primitiue, as part of all the <hi>Syndrome</hi> and vniuerſall courſe: but the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue cauſe ſerueth nothing to the indication of curing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:18258:72"/> it be profitable to knowe of the nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, to them that haue not knowen the nature of veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſts, by vſe and experience, and thereof taketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication curatiue, trulie the outward cauſe of curation bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowen, doth nothing profite to the indication, but to the knowledge of the preſent affect. For put we the caſe that we knowe that the venime of a Scorpion is of a colde nature, and for that cauſe, as of a colde thing, I take Indication for the remedye, howbeit the caſe is ſuth, that I haue no ſigne, whereby I doe vnderſtand that the bodie is hurt of a Scorpion: it is manifeſt that if I doe knowe that the bodie is hurt of a Scorpion, that then I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force me to warme all the whole bodie, and alſo the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, without abiding for anie experience, in taking mine indication of the nature of the thing. We haue declared in the booke of Medicaments, wherein it behoueth them to be exerciſed, that will take anie profit of theſe preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, no ſuch facultie can be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without experience. Truelie it ſhould be a gifte of felicitie, if anie hauing the ſight of <hi>Litargerium, Caſtoreum,</hi> or <hi>Cantarides,</hi> forthwith to vnderſtand their vertues: For like as in all things is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted error, as well by thoſe that excéede, as by thoſe that lacke, ſo héere (as the Prouerbe is among the Gréekes) this <hi>Thiapauſon,</hi> that is to ſaie, they differ among themſelues. Alſo they affirme, that the vertue of medicines is not yet knowen, and that after ſo great experience, &amp; the other that ſuppoſe and ſaie, that the ſaide vertues be knowen onelie by experience. The firſt ſpeaketh vndiſcréetlie, if that be a thing imprudent, to affirme a thing impoſſible, &amp; the other be altogether ſtupidious, ſturdie, and fooliſh. But for this preſent time we will ſaie no more, becauſe I haue ſpoken more plainlie in the third booke of Temperame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; alſo in the bookes of Medicaments. Neuertheleſſe for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of diſeaſes, ſome primitiue cauſes are profitable, but after that the preſent diſeaſe is altogether knowen, then the cauſe primitiue is totallie vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>Now we haue declared that it doeth not become vs to meddle and confound both the doctrines together, but the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18258:72"/> Emperikes ought to be ſpoken by themſelues, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals by themſelues. We muſt now call to mind, becauſe we haue purpoſed in this preſent Commentarie, to intreate of the doctrine Rationall, although to ſome things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do ſaie, we doe not adde abſolutelie that all be not true, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after the ſentence of the methodicall ſort: but that euery man ought to adde and reaſon that thing by himſelfe. And at this time we haue ſaid that there is no cauſe primitiue, which is profitable to the Indication curatiue, although it ſerueth well to the knowledge of the diſeaſe. And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the cauſe primitiue is part of the <hi>Syndrome,</hi> and of all the Emperikes courſe, that they cure all diſeaſes by reaſon &amp; by experience. But in all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhall ſaie héereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, it is not neceſſarie to adde ſuch words. Then let vs returne to our firſt purpoſe, in taking the principall indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation certaine and vndoubtfull, whereof we haue alſo vſed héere before, as we haue ſaid, that the diſeaſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> requireth to be cured, iudgeth the end whervnto the Surgion ought to intend, and of the ſame all other indications are taken. Wherefore we haue begun to ſpeake, that the ſaid indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath no manner of affinitie with the cauſe primitiue: for put we the caſe that anie vlcer be come of a fluxe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie part, then it is manifeſt that the ſayde vlcer procéedeth of corrupt humours, for nature is accuſtomed ſo for to doe in diſeaſes, when ſhe purgeth the bodie, and ſendeth all the corruption to the ſkinne, in ſuch ſort, that the ſkin is vlce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and all the bodie purged.</p>
               <p>What is then the curation of ſuch vlcers? certainlie as of other vlcers, wherein no corrupt affect or diſpoſition is, which the Gréekes call <hi>Cacoethae.</hi> But if it be ſo, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no indication is to be taken of the cauſe which hath exciſed the vlcer, but if the vicious humour remaine, ſome indication might then be taken of the ſaide cauſe, for otherwiſe it ſhould be an abſurde thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which is no more remaining, ſhuld require curation, or if he ſhuld ſhew curation where there is no néede. Wherfore it is a ſtrange thing, and wholie againſt reaſon, to ſaie that the indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on curatiue ought to be taken of the cauſe primitiue.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:73"/>
               <p>And for becauſe that the ſaid Indication is not taken of the ſame cauſe, it is euident, that it muſt be taken of the cauſe preſent.</p>
               <p>But what is ſuch an Indication? forſooth if a man will properlie define it, it is a thing which appertaineth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, (which the Gréekes call <hi>Prophalacticae,</hi>) but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie will abuſe the word, it is called <hi>Therapeutica.</hi> But for as much as of the vlcers themſelues, certaine be ſimple, and certaine be hollow, (if a man will diligentlie marke and conſider) the curation of them is brought to paſſe in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuing and foreſéeing thoſe things which bée hurtfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature. And when we woulde bring anie thing to good ſucceſſe, wee had néede of Natures helpe, as in cloſing of an Vlcer, and regeneration of fleſh, in the which things the chiefeſt care and regard appertaineth vnto that part of the arte, which is called Prouidence, but it is called vulgarly healing.</p>
               <p>And therefore this part of the art that is named Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is diuided into two kindes. The one is that which doth remoue awaie the diſeaſe preſent, the other which withſtandeth the diſeaſe, that it maye not come to his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Therefore the younger Phiſitions héere doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that their diſputation and contention conſiſteth onely in names, wherfore if they were ſtudious in things, they ſhould finde out that there were two differences of the functions and actions of medicine, that is to ſaie, the diſeaſe alreadie come, or to withſtand thoſe that are not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Then there is no man but he wil confeſſe, that to cure or to heale, is no other thing, but to take awaie the diſeaſe that is preſent, whether it be done awaie by the worke of nature or by medicines, but prouidence is a thing that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the diſeaſe, that hée may not come, &amp; truelie they which doe cure the ill humours which come to the vlcer, doe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the art of medicine by reaſon and methode, in purging and taking awaie thoſe things which doe hinder the courſe of Nature. And theſe two manners of curing are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called in Gréeke <hi>Prophilactica,</hi> (for they let, as it was ſayde before,) that the filthie mattier engendereth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18258:73"/> not in the vlcer, neither yet ouermuch moiſture, which may hinder the curation.</p>

And if they ceaſe not with theſe things, you ought to haue cure of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, in ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening it with diuerſe exercitations, geſtings, and vocife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in commanding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that kéepe him, to ſuch things as theſe be: That is to ſaie, in manner of liuing, by dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing or augmenting, by degrées, in beginning, &amp; vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, made by <hi>Raphanus.</hi> You ſhall alſo vſe white <hi>Eliber,</hi> and all other thinges which we vſe in diſeaſes that be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to take awaie, which are ſubiect to reaſon and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of liuing. This is the ſaying of <hi>Theſſalus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is time to conſider the ſtupiditie of the man, (I ſaie the ſtupiditie) if he thinke he hath ſayde well, and the boldneſſe of him culpable to ſaie nothing, and by this meanes ſuppoſeth to deceiue the Readers. But tell mée <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> what is the Indication curatiue that is taken of an olde Vlcer? Trulie I neuer found out curation of the olde Vlcers, nor of the newe, not by time, in what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſo euer it bée, but of the affect that I purpoſed to cure. But if we altogether regard time, as if the Indication cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue were taken of it, the ſecond daie we ſhould giue an other indication than the third, &amp; likewiſe to giue the fourth daie another, then the fift, and ſo of the ſixt, &amp; all other daies following.</p>
               <p>For by this meanes we ſhall no more conſider the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the diſeaſe that we goe about to cure, and the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation no more to bée taken of them, whereby we coulde neuer thinke of a ſtraunger reaſon: howe then are the communities of vlcers neceſſarie, that continue a greate while, ſeeing that the time it ſelfe can indicate nothing at all. For when an Vlcer is with eroſion that commeth of all humours, we ſhall not take an Indication of it after foure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>neths, but that which we haue taken at the verie beginning.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:18258:74"/>
               <p>And for a truth, that I may not permit ſuch an vlcer to abide ſo long time, but at the firſt I will take awaie the cauſe thereof. But I cannot coniecture what may ſhewe the time more than the number of daies, except <hi>Theſſalus</hi> will ſaie, that to haue knowledge of ſuch an vlcer, we muſt tarrie the time, but in ſuch a caſe he ſheweth himſelfe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fooliſh. That is to ſaie, if he confeſſe openlie that hée knoweth not the firſt affect, which hath inueterated the vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. Furthermore, he muſt plainlie alſo confeſſe the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation curatiue to be taken of the diſeaſe, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the diſeaſe to be taken of other things. But bée it ſo, that time ſerueth ſomewhat to the diſeaſe, neuertheleſſe the Indication curatiue is not taken of time. But to what purpoſe ſerueth it, if any Vlcer bée inueterate, to do away y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which letteth the coition, &amp; to renue the place which is pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For thou fooliſh fellow, if for the maligne fluxe which the Gréekes call <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> the lippes be affected in ſuch ſort, what ſhalt thou profit if thou doe cut them, before thou haſt prouided to ſtop the fluxe? Trulie thou ſhalt but make the Vlcer wider than it is, as ſome doe that cure vlcers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as thou doeſt. For the cauſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which before made the vlcer harde and flintie, thou ſhalt doe no other thing in cutting awaie the lips, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the vlcer. For thoſe which thou cutteſt ſhall be made hard, &amp; come again as they were before. Although that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Theſſalus</hi> hath not added this thing, that the partes of the vlcer which are hard, ſtonie, and diſcouloured, ought to be cut awaie, but commandeth by an abſolute ſentence, that thoſe thinges which hinder the cloſing of the vlcer, ought to be cut awaie and to be renued. But if trulie hée had counſailed to take awaie the cauſes that hinder the adglutination of the vlcer, and that this reaſon were aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and olde, I would not accuſe him, for it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded almoſt of all the auncient Phiſitions, which doe write of the curation of vlcers, by a certaine reaſon and Method, that thoſe cauſes which doe excite the vlcers ought to be cut awaie, euen trulie, as of all other diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>For trulie I do thinke it expedient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the efficient cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:18258:75"/> remaining, which exciteth the vlcers, ought firſt to be taken awaie. In other diſeaſes, it is not expedient, but chieflie there the curation muſt be taken in hand, where the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe remaineth. And if the ſayd <hi>Theſſalus</hi> hath not ſpoken of the cauſes that let the conglutination, and hath onelie ſpoken of the lips (as he hath ſaid afterward) it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he is ignorant of more than he knoweth, of thoſe things which appertaineth to the curation of vlcers. But it is poſſible that this alone is the cauſe which hindereth the cure of the vlcer. And it may (as it is aforeſaid) be the cauſe that intemperauncie, which is without a tumour againſt nature, be in the vlcerate partes, and alſo that it be ioyned with a tomour, the which doth not require that the lips ſhould be altogether cut awaie. It maye alſo bée the cauſe that <hi>Varix,</hi> which is aboue it, or that the milt which augmenteth it, or ſome diſeaſe in the liuer, and beſide this, the weakneſſe of the affected part be nothing elſe, but a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt intemperancie.</p>
               <p>And beſides this, a vicious humour in the bodie, which the Gréekes call <hi>Cacochimia,</hi> and the chiefeſt of all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which may be to the vlcers an incommoditie. Truelie great abundance of humours, which the Gréekes call <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora,</hi> reſorting vnto the vlcer, doeth hinder the curation. But if <hi>Theſſalus</hi> be of that opinion, that the lippes onelie muſt be taken awaie, I ſaie, that of many things he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but one alone, which is ſo euident, that the ſhepheards are not ignorant thereof, for if a ſhepheard ſawe the lips of an vlcer, hard, flintie, wan, blacke, or a leadie coulour, hée would not doubt to cut it awaie.</p>
               <p>Then for to cut awaie is an eaſie thing, but for to cure by medicines is a greater matter, and that requireth a true methode. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Theſſalus</hi> neuer knew howe the lips might be cured by medicines, for all men confeſſe that he hath ſwarued from this part of the art, and as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſhewed, it ſéemeth that he had neither experience nor rationall knowledge of medicines, which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thing by the booke that he hath made of medicines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearſed. But of this one worke conſequent, wée
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18258:75"/> ſhall entreate of thoſe things which hée hath not writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n well.</p>
               <p>And now we doe intend with deliberation to ſpeake of the curation of inueterate vlcers, of the which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreated. Certainlie it had bene better to haue called them <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> and not inueterate, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to declare their nature, diſpoſition, and cauſe of their generation, and the curation of either of them.</p>
               <p>And firſt to know the common curation of all vlcers, for as much as they be vlcers, of the which I haue written in the third booke, next after the perticular and proper cure of either of them, afterward the kinde of the efficient cauſe, as I haue ſpoken of in this preſent booke. And although <hi>Theſſalus</hi> hath done nothing of all theſe things, yet he doth thinke that the vlcerate place muſt be renued, when it is made like vnto a new wound, to cure it as a bloudie vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, what is he that is exerciſed in the workes of the Arte, that vnderſtandeth not euidentlie, that ſuch a doctrine hath bene written by him that neuer cured vlcer? Is it poſſible that a man may cure an inueterate vlcer, as you may cure a bloudie wound, and after he hath made it lyke vnto a freſh wound, ſhall it be in drawing of the vlcer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by rollers? or ioyning them by ſtitches? or neither by the one or by the other? but by conuenient medicines? What is he that knoweth not, that an vlcer called <hi>Cachoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae</hi> is caued or hollow, ſéeing that it is made by corroſion? Is it poſſible (O foole and impudent <hi>Theſſalus</hi>) that a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vlcer may grow together, and be adglutinated, before the cauitie be filled with fleſh? is not that to cure an vlcer as a gréene wound? then haſt thou thy ſelfe written in vaine, that hath taken indication to cure caued vlcers, not with cloſing, but with the filling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauitie. But if euery vlcer called <hi>Cachoethae</hi> were not hollowe of it ſelfe, yet when it is made bloudie in cutting the lips awaie (as thou commaundeſt) then of neceſſitie it is made hollow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth great ſpace betwixt the lips: euen in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that I cannot ſée how thou maiſt make them conglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate together as a bloudie wound: for if thou aſſaie by
<pb facs="tcp:18258:76"/> force and violence the lippes that are ſo farre a ſonder, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie there commeth Phlegmon, which letteth the ſayde lyppes to cloſe together. The which thing I ſuppoſe, that <hi>Theſſalus</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not. For he ſaith after theſe words. If the vlcer be not bound, thou muſt mittigate the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for it is neceſſary that they be not bound, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the ſame is giuen of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> and that we paſſe ouer ſo ſoone without any curious examination, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to euerye one that he followeth not the communitie which he himſelfe hath giuen. For if wée take that which letteth, we ſhall take nothing of the communitie of inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate vlcers, for as much as they be ſuch. But put wée the caſe that it be ſo, and let vs trye what followeth. <hi>Theſſalus</hi> wryteth in this manner.</p>
               <p>The vlcer that commeth to a ciccatrice ſhalbe cured, in the exceſſe, an vlcer in ſuch a manner ſhalbe cured as they that haue bene lately greued with inflammation. Then after, he ſaith, you muſt cauſe the redneſſe to come to the parts that are about it, by a plaiſter that he called reuola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, which is made of muſtrad ſéede. What ſaiſt thou mad foole? if thy flux be bitter and hot, muſt the place be made red with muſtardſéede, euen in ſuch ſorte, that all the part ſhall receiue flux by the ſame medicine; that is to ſay, that it be all vlcerate and red? For the olde writers made the parts that were weakened with abundaunce of colde hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, hot againe with warming of them, and making of them red, but thou vſeſt rubification in all vlcers, yea and that without making of any difference. And thus if the vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer be not cured either by the weakneſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part, or by the making of the flux greater, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou turneſt to another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of curing. For after that thou haſt inflamed the part with Muſterd ſéede, &amp; haſt profited nothing, then thou tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt againe to the curation of all the bodie. Yet as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in my iudgement, all the countries be ordered &amp; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, in ſuch things, as well by reaſon, as by experience, that they know, that all the body ſhould be firſt purged of thoſe ſuperfluities, before they doe miniſter any hot or ſharp medicines vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greued part. For all thoſe medicines that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18258:76"/> be hot, drawe vnto them from all partes of the bodie, lyke vnto Ventoſis or boxes, and if you doe not firſt purge the bodie, thou ſhalt leaue mattier to flow vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weake place, that may be drawen by the ſharpe medicine, which thing both the Emperikes and alſo the Dogmatiſts confeſſe, and alſo the auncient writers haue eſtéemed it ſo. For in as much as <hi>Theſſalus</hi> hath made mention of them, it ſhall bee no ſtraunge thing to alleadge to them as witneſſes, that it is not lawfull to cure the eie well, before all the reſt of the head, neither the head before the reſt of the bodie. Such was the ſentence of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> in the cure of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: likewiſe of <hi>Hyppocrates, Diocles, Praxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Pliſtonichus,</hi> but <hi>Theſſalus</hi> opinion is not ſo, but commeth firſt to the compoſition of Muſtarſéed, and then he hath ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitated and troubled all to bodie, without ſhewing of anie thing wiſely.</p>
               <p>For when as it is lawfull firſt to purge all the bodie, and then forthwith to féede it with wholſome meates, then <hi>Theſſalus</hi> commeth, and vſeth for theſe thinges, vociferati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exercitations, geſtings, and chaunge of liuing, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circuites and actes, then he commeth to the vomite made with <hi>Raphanus,</hi> and for the whole concluſion, he doth miniſter <hi>Eliber.</hi> Trulie he himſelfe doth promiſe to heale all diſeaſes, euen after this ſort, verie eaſilie, but I cannot vnderſtand how that anie hath bene cured after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, either in long ſpace of time, or by vnprofible la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Now then like as we haue ſéene by vſe &amp; experience, put we the caſe that there be one to be cured of a maligne Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer called <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> put we the caſe alſo, that there is an other that is in good health, except a ſcratch of his arme, or of, anie other place, by mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> whereof there is an vlcer or a puſtle, then within a little while after there commeth an itch to the partie, and after the puſtule is breken, ther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a diſcloſed vlcer, with vnequall fretting, &amp; that ſuch things be come in foure daies.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe let anie of <hi>Theſſalus</hi> ſect anſwere me in what maner we ſhuld cure ſuch an vlcer, I cal it altogether
<pb facs="tcp:18258:77"/> 
                  <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> and therefore I will conſider what is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and affect of all the whole bodie. For I will firſt finde out of what kinde of humour this doth come, as well by the <hi>Symptomata</hi> of the vlcer, as by the ſignes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, then forſooth I will purge the ſaid ſuperfluous humor without tarrying anie longer, leaſt the patient get anie diſeaſe ſtubburne or diſobedient to be cured. But the ſect of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> that obſerue his preceptes, will tarrie vntill the vlcer be olde, becauſe it may returne to the wonderous and meruailous communitie of inueterate vlcers, as if it were not much better to giue the communitie of froward vlcers, I doe not meane thoſe that be veterate, ſhall make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the curation.</p>
               <p>Afterward the ſaid Theſſalions would doe one of both theſe, either they woulde cut the vlcer, and make it as it were freſh, and ſo bring the parts to adglutination, or elſe they would firſt vſe the <hi>Malagma</hi> that is made of muſtard-ſéede, and if neither of theſe profit, they will haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to the vociferations, geſtations, and other exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and alſo to the manner of liuing that chaungeth by circuities, and after they will moue vomit by <hi>Raphanus,</hi> and if the vlcer be not cured by ſuch things, then they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter <hi>Eliber,</hi> and if the <hi>Eliber</hi> doe nothing profit, they ſend the patient into <hi>Libia</hi> for change of aire. <hi>Theſſalus</hi> ought to haue added this word, after this excellent and ſingular cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of rebellious vlcers.</p>
               <p>For of a truth the Theſſalians ſtand in vociferations, geſtations, and other like things, as if they ſhould cure the euill habitude of the bodie, (which the Gréekes call <hi>Cacex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia</hi>) and not the vice of the humour (that the Gréeks call <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chochimia.</hi>) Is it not meruaile if they confeſſe that they know not the vlcer <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> as ſoone as it is made, and that they will tarrie till it be olde, and that often they vſe ciccatriſe, and open againe many times ere they vnderſtand what they doe, and how they counſaile thoſe that haue the feauers to paſſe the fit, which ſhall come the third daie, or not, they trulie haue verie well knowen the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the criſe, and can foreſée by it the chiefe increaſing of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18258:77"/> the diſeaſe. But what chaunceth thereof moſt often? truely it followeth, that the pacients abide in their beds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume through their default, which might haue bene cured the ſecond daye. Of a truth we haue not onely ſéene this chaunce, once, twiſe, or thriſe, but vi. C. times, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt fit was paſt, we waſhed the ſicke perſons that had the feuer, which thing we haue ſéene done of our predeceſſors &amp; maiſters. And conſequently we haue ſuffered them to liue without feare in their manner accuſtomed, as they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhould no more haue the feuer, whome wiſe <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the firſt dyet, that is to ſay, not to eate in thrée daies, hath dryed and conſumed onely through hunger. Then as I coniecture, he would féede them a little on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth day, and ſo nouriſh them by little and little, in ſuch wiſe, that they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> had but once the feuer, ſhould ſkant go about their cuſtomable buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Truely he conſumed his pacients alway in their diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the which truely very eaſely might haue bene cured.</p>
               <p>For when an vlcer dyd ſwell at the beginning, <hi>Theſſalus</hi> did ſuffer it to runne a yeare and more, and taryed often ſo long till the ſaid vlcer oftentimes produced cicatrice, when as before it might in fewe daies haue bene cured, and alſo he would often open it, to ſée if it were maligne and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne to cure. Then after that he began the curation, he purged not foorthwith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie, but firſt of all vſed his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagma</hi> of Muſterdſéede, and then his geſtes, vociferations, &amp; certaine manners of liuing, and then his vomit of <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and laſt of all <hi>Eliber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this I praye you then for to linger a whole yeare? (Now by the liuing God) it were a great madneſſe if we ſhould prolong a moneth to know if the vlcer be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne, and then take in hand the curation, when as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in vi. or vii. daies, at the vttermoſt, may be cured. But what neceſſitie was it to ſpeake of the communitie of vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers inueterate, ſéeing that nothing may profit the curatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof? Truely it were good leauing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatrice, to write of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curation of vlcers, I doe not meane inueterate, but ſuch as be ſtuburne and rebellious in cure.
<pb facs="tcp:18258:78"/> For ſometime it happeneth that vlcers and diſeaſes be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumatious and ſtubburne to cure. How be it Indication curatiue is not taken of this contumacie and rebellion, but it is the diſeaſe that geueth the firſt indication of curing. And of the firſt indicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the remedies, as I haue declared, are found out. For the way to cure by methode, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we vſe, in following the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wryters, if ſo be that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode is a vniuerſall way, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all perticular things.</p>
               <p>Herein <hi>Theſſalus</hi> truly is beguiled, for he thinketh that all the knowledge of them, which doe any thing by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, is very methode, which is not ſo. For it behoueth that he which doth any thing by methode, haue notice and knowledge in the like and vnlike. Neuertheleſſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of like and vnlike is not methode: for neither <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> nor yet <hi>Plato,</hi> affirmeth that which <hi>Theſſalus</hi> dare falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleadge. But now it is not conuenient to proue &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute ſuch matters: wherefore I will returne againe to the Methode curatiue, and truely I will ſhew vnto you the principle of methode in all curations, and alſo I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way in all particular things is like, which leadeth from that principle to the ende. Wherfore, although in all diſeaſes there ſéemeth a proper methode of curing, neuertheleſſe there is in all things one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for it behoueth to begin alwayes at the indication of the diſeaſe, which we take in hand to cure, &amp; then we muſt way and conſider, if the cauſe which excited the diſeaſe, be alreadie ceaſed, or augmenteth the ſame diſeaſe. If the ſayd cauſe be eaſed, then we muſt come to the methode, whereof we haue here declared: by the which methode thou ſhalt learne the remedies of an inflammation, and of a Feuer, and alſo how I will ſhortly intreate of the curation of all diſeaſes. For if nothing be done, thou ſhalt not take paine to enquire the precedent cauſes, but ſhalt begin onely at the diſeaſe. But if any thing be done preſently, thou ſhalt take two indications of curation.</p>
               <p>Now I cannot but maruell at the ſect of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> not bicauſe they miſſe in ſuch things: but becauſe they vſe theſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18258:78"/> names, <hi>Diſpathies, Metaſincriſis,</hi> imbecillities, firmitudes, &amp; other ſuch names. And if you aſke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what ſuch names meane, they wot not what to aunſwere. Alſo if you aſke what that ſignifieth, which they call in all inueterate vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in Gréeke <hi>Metaſuncrinem ten texin,</hi> they aunſwer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prudently, nor yet with conſideration. If ſo be that it were an auncient name vſurped by any of the gréekes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture by theſe things we may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what things they haue written, and for what intent they haue ſpoken the ſame. But becauſe it is a point of their foliſhneſſe, &amp; impudencie, to ſaye that it is come of the <hi>Hipotheſe</hi> of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiades,</hi> like as their other decrées, therfore it were a thing moſt conuenient that they interprete their owne dreames. From whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there is a notable ſaying among the Gréekes: <hi>Sincrineſtai, Ta ſomata, cai Thiacrineſtai,</hi> which meaneth thus, mingle and deuide bodies, as though it were lawfull to vſurpe ſuch little bodies, which they call <hi>Atones,</hi> &amp; pores, paſſages indiuidable and vacuate, or finally the inſenſible and inalterable things to be the firſt elements, euen as they truely doe dayly vſurpe. Furthermore, <hi>Theſſalus</hi> in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, when he confirmeth the principles, addeth ſomething beſide that, which was written by <hi>Themiſon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> &amp; as far as he vnderſtandeth, he wryteth not obſcurely, but he hath not imitated <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> altogither in Simitry: that is to ſay, that health conſiſteth in compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſmall cundites or paſſages, and that curation is no other thing, but a returne to the firſt ſimitrie, or comode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaid cundits. But <hi>Theſſalus</hi> ſuppoſeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the ſtate &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid cundits muſt be changed, &amp; by this opinion doth procede the name of <hi>Metaſincriſis,</hi> which may ſignifie in effect <hi>Metaporopoieſeſeos</hi> in gréeke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſtate of ſmal cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dits &amp; pores, but it did not become him to vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names of dogmatiſts in place where he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to eſchew the vncertaine &amp; darke names.</p>
               <p>Then his diſciples anſwereth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he muſt not be hard as a dogmatiſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vſeth this name <hi>Aphelos</hi> in greke, that is to ſay ſimply. For of a truth, ſome of his diſciples are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to defend him in this manner, in reuocing vs to
<pb facs="tcp:18258:79"/> another name that is <hi>Aphelian,</hi> which we tranſlate ſimple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the which name truely I cannot tell what it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For if he ſend vs againe to another name more fooliſh, which the Gréekes call <hi>Vioticos,</hi> the which as they expound doth ſignifie likewiſe ſo vnto the common people: truely it were as good to ſay, <hi>Aphelos</hi> not exactly or well, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arte or knowledge, for they which be of ſpéeche moſt lighteſt, vſe names of artes, vnder ſome ſenſe, that hath no foundation, &amp; when they are demaunded what they meane, they know not. The which thing thoſe <hi>Theſſalians</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe to be their manner and cuſtome, when we doe obiect any thing againſt them. And for a truth, they will alſo confeſſe, that they vnderſtand not perfectly, what <hi>Metacincriſis</hi> is, if it be ſpoken of the mutation of the ſmal cundits, which the Gréekes call <hi>Poropoia,</hi> in déede it ſhould haue ſome vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but yet many wayes friuolous and fooliſh. For our bodies doe not conſiſt of little bodies called <hi>Atomes,</hi> and of little paſſages, or pores: but if this were true, it ſhould not be poſſible to ſhewe in what maner, muſterd might change or alter the ſtate of the ſame pores, &amp; if any of them ſhould ſhew the truth, yet we would not agrée vnto their ſect, becauſe they promiſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wil be content with their apparent communities: therefore lette them not vſe theſe names, neither let them hinder vs no more in our matters. For it is lawfull without the name <hi>Metaſincriſis,</hi> to ſay in other wordes the curation of inueterate vlcers, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perickes doe.</p>
               <p>Alſo we haue declared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond booke, how they talke of this woord <hi>Atonias,</hi> that is to ſay, imbecilitie, &amp; yet know not what it meaneth. For if they vſe this name as the Emperickes do, then it ſhould ſignifie nothing elſe but that the actions are not kept: for if they ſay that certaine facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doe gouerne liuing creatures, which we &amp; all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers doe affirme, but yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne againſt the precepts of <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> &amp; alſo they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vncertaine things, to the which the authors doe not agrée: they touch the truth a little, yet they commaund to eſchew it.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:18258:79"/>
               <p>But tell me true <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> what meaneth this worde <hi>Metaſincriſis?</hi> if thou ſaie that it betokeneth to change the pores, thou art deceiued, and ſuppoſeſt vncertaine thinges. But if thou ſaiſt that it is a great matter to cure the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle grieued of the bodie, as the man, thou ſaiſt no more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperikes, except the name. For they doe knowe that men are made whole by medicines, but they know not the cauſe or reaſon, by what meanes the remedies reſtoreth health. For none of the Emperikes can tell, if the facultie of the medicaments chaungeth the pores, or if it maketh a Simitrie, or if it altereth the qualitie of the Patients par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle that is grieued. Howbeit the Emperikes are diſcréete men, if they ſaie that they know onelie one thing, that is to ſaie, if they haue noted and obſerued the times, how vtilitie hath followed, when the medicament of muſtard hath ben miniſtred to ſuch vlcers, and in what time. Neuertheleſſe they ſpeake not of method, neither yet repugne againſt it, neither be diſpleaſed with the notiſe thereof, nor diſpraiſe the ancient writers, neither <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> but rather praiſe him, and affirme that he hath ſaid all thinges well. But <hi>Theſſalus</hi> doth not onlie deſpiſe <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> but all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other auncient Phiſitions, neither doth he vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath written all the precepts of rebellious vlcers, without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, emperiklie. For if he had written them well, then it ſhould haue bene counted a worke moſt profitable. But it appeareth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath done ſo, ſéeing that he peruerteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right order of remedies, and vſeth his remedies to the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued part, before he hath prepared the bodie. For this is an argument of great ignorance, ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> almoſt it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Chirurgerie, that all the bodie muſt be purged of the euill excrementes, before anie ſtrong medicine be applyed vnto the affected parte. For who is he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will iudge either by reaſon or experience, for there is no other third thing to iudge by, in what art ſo euer it be, nor in anie part of life, he ſhal finde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is agréeable to reaſon, for a man to miniſter ſtrong &amp; hot medicines to anie particle of the bodie, before he hath purged the bodie of all anoiance, &amp; prepared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to health: for the ſaid medicine draweth the excrements and
<pb facs="tcp:18258:80"/> ſuperfluities from all the bodie, like as boxing or Vento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis doth, &amp; it doth ſo faſten to the affected part, that it may be ſcarcelie remoued. Therefore it muſt be aſked of theſe Theſſalions, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence this opinion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> to write fables as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of rebellious vlcers, ſéeing that none of the Emperiks, nor yet Rationals, haue written ſo before this time. For neither <hi>Theſſalus</hi> himſelfe, neither anie other of his ſect, dare affirme, that the order of ſuch remedies, either doth agrée with experience or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For neither can they giue Indication of time, neither yet of the affect of the diſeaſe. Yet for all that, <hi>Theſſalus</hi> is not all together ignorant, becauſe he iudgeth, that the cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hindereth the ciccatriſe muſt be conſidered and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, &amp; becauſe alſo that he iudgeth, that this muſt be done not onelie in vlcers, but alſo in all other diſeaſes, (as the ancient writers do admoniſh.) But they anſwere nothing to the purpoſe, for they ſaie alwaies, that we do not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, as if they knew perfectly the thought of <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and of all the ancients. And they affirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalus</hi> hath a good opinion, when he ſaith, that there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie of inueterate vlcers, &amp; that <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it ſo, in his booke of Vlcers, which writeth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is profitable that the bloud doe flowe continually from the inueterate vlcer, when ſo euer it ſéemeth néedfull. It were not farre from my purpoſe, if I ſhould ſpeak of the iudgement and opinion of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> though I haue not promiſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I would ſo do in this place. But that which I will ſaie, ſhall be of the interpretation of the wit &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the auncient Phiſitions, the which truelie as yet haue giuen no ſect, but ſtudying with ſimple &amp; pure minde, to inuent ſome thing profitable to mans health. It is well perceiued therfore, that they haue found ſome thing by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſome thing by vſe and experience. Then dyd they write their inuentions, many times without giuing reaſon thereto, and ſometime they did, and if they did giue anie reaſon, it was to profit the readers. For if they intended to be profitable to their ſucceſſors, and when as they knew reaſon of inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting things, then diligentlie they ſet it forth,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18258:80"/> and where they thought it obſcure, they thought it ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to rehearſe, and therefore let it paſſe. Now it is well knowen vnto all men, though I hold my peace, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients haue loued no verboſitie. For that cauſe afore reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> but alſo all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, ſometime not making mention of the middlemoſt, ſpeaketh of the third thing. For if the firſt be a ſigne of the ſecond, the third of neceſſitie muſt followe after the ſecond,</p>
               <p>And thus oftentimes omitting the firſt and ſecond, they ſpake of the third. I haue oftentimes declared how the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and chieflie <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> haue written after this manner. But he that will know and perfectlie vnderſtand the maner of curing, ought to be exerciſed in their ſtile and manner of interpreting. For this I will intreate of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I haue purpoſed.</p>

But we haue ſpoken in the booke aforeſaid, what the curation of vlcers is. Therefore in theſe kindes of vlcers that be maligne, we may vſe theſe names indifferentlie, that is to ſaie, we call them <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate, or <hi>Diuturnus.</hi> In like manner the affect of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe called <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> that is to ſaie, ſtubburne and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious to be cured, that maketh ſome thing for our purpoſe to know, neuertheleſſe the ſaide diuturnitie of the ſaide vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, becauſe they come againe, or be of long continuance, &amp; waxe olde, haue no conuenient indication of curing, but that muſt hée conſidered, becauſe the vlcerate part is ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that ill affect béeing once knowen, the cure is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt aſke, how can this be done? trulie if thou wilt heale the vlcerate part affected, thou muſt firſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the abundance and corrupt vicious humors from all
<pb facs="tcp:18258:81"/> the bodie: for in cleanſing awaie the ſame, the diuturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is taken awaie, but the finding out, which is profitable to vs, commeth not firſt of the diuturnitie, but of the ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition &amp; malignitie of the humour, by meanes whereof theſe thrée things following, muſt chiefly be conſidered, that is, the ſigne, the affect, and curation. The ſigne is the diuturnitie or continuance of the vlcer, the affect, is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious humours repairing to the vlcer, and the curation is the taking awaie of the ſaide humours. By this meanes you ſhall finde that the auncient Phiſitions manie times after the firſt, made mention of the third, leauing the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt, as <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> did, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, it is vtill to cauſe the bloud to flowe out often of inueterate vlcers. But it is inutill, that the indication curatiue ſhould be taken of the diuturnitie of the vlcer, but of the ill diſpoſition of the bloud. For a little after he ſaith thus: the vice and euill bloud hindereth greatlie the cure of the ſaid vlcers. Alſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of the bloud, &amp; all things that commeth by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the bloud, letteth alſo the curation of the ſayd vlcers. And afterward he ſpeaketh of vlcers that come not to a cicatriſe: The vlcers trulie (ſaith he) may not be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together, if the lips and partes that are rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, be ſwart or blacke, with rotten bloud or Variſes that cauſeth the fluxe, if you cure not the ſayd partes that bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, they will not come together. And afterward hée writeth of the cure of Variſes, and then maketh mention of the purging of all the bodie, as well in woundes as in Vlcers, where feare of daunger or putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Gréeke called <hi>Sphaſelos,</hi> doth remaine, and beſides in Vlcers called <hi>Herpes</hi> and <hi>Eſthioninus,</hi> that is to ſaie, which doe erode and eate the ſkinne. And thus <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> is wont to call thoſe vlcers, after this ſorte, wherein anie ill humour doth cauſe eroſin. And thus when he ſpeaketh of them that enſueth, he ſaith in ſuch wordes: In euerie Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer whereas chanceth Eriſipelas, all the bodie muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And finallie, if you reade diligentlie the booke of vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, you ſhall finde that he taketh Indication alwaies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affect of the diſeaſe, &amp; if he haue anie conſideration of time,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18258:81"/> it is onelie to knowe the affect. And that it is ſo, you may know it in the beginning of the ſaid booke, which concludeth thus: You may not miniſter anie moiſt thing to Vlcers, what vlcers ſo euer they be, but wine. Then ſheweth hée the cauſe, (and ſaith,) Drie vlcers are néereſt to health, and moiſt the contrarie, then after he ſaith, it is an vlcer for that it is moiſt, but if it be dry, it is whole. Therfore in all his cure, in as much as he hath conſtituted the end of al the cure of vlcers to be drineſſe, it ought to be conſidered. Then he findeth out the perticular thinges, admoniſhing vs manie times of the ſame end, writing in this manner: Euerie wound that is diuided with a cutting Inſtrument, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth medicines in the beginning that ought to be applied to rawe and bloudie wounds, the which Medicamentes in Greeke is called <hi>Enaimon,</hi> which is, drying, and letteth the wound to come to ſuppuration, for it is more drier by the reaſon of the bloud which floweth out of it. And agayne <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſayth, All vlcers that are well purged, they come ſooner to dryneſſe and ciccatrize, but if anie ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fleſh do grow, it is by the reaſon of ſome contuſion. And againe he ſaith, if that anie of the wound cannot conſode to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the moiſtneſſe is the cauſe thereof. In all theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> admoniſheth vs of the firſt Indication curatiue of all Vlcers: for of a truth, the curation of an Vlcer, for as much as it is an vlcer, is moderate dryneſſe, whereof the demonſtration hath bene giuen in the booke going before.</p>
               <p>For the curation of an vlcer that is coniunct with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affect, whereof the cure ought to procéede, is not like to a ſimple vlcer, for the firſt curation of ſuch a one as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct with anie other affect, ſhall begin firſt of the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and then at the vlcer. For if there be either <hi>Phlegmon</hi> or ſwart coulour, or <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> or <hi>Eryſipilas,</hi> or <hi>Oedema,</hi> in the vlcerate part, firſt you muſt begin the curation, at one of the ſayde affectes. Neuertheleſſe all men knowe well, that ſometimes theſe Vlcers are not well cured, but are made greater, for that the partes round about the Vlcer, is affected either with Phlegmon, either by bruſing,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:82"/> either with ſome other tumour, which ſhould haue ben firſt taken awaie, before you had procéeded to the cure of the vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. And for a certaintie, it is not poſſible to heale the vlcer, if the place where theſe be, be not firſt cured. And therefore <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> putteth vs in memorie of thoſe things which he hath ſpoken of in the beginning of his booke, and alſo of thoſe things before eſpecified, and of thoſe that be preſent he writeth thus.</p>
               <p>Euerie wound that is diuided with a cutting Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſharpe pointed, receiueth Medicament called <hi>Enae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and alſo a medicament deſiccatiue, that may let the filthie mattier. But if the fleſh be contuſed or cut with a blunt weapon, remedie muſt be giuen in ſuch wiſe, that it come ſoone to ſuppuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in ſo doing, it ſhal be the leſſe moleſted and grieued with Phlegmon. And alſo it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that the putrified fleſh, which hath bene contuſed &amp; inciſed, come firſt to ſuppuration, and afterward new fleſh to be engendered. By theſe wordes <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſheweth manifeſtlie, that all the affects of the vlcerate partes ought to be deſiccated, except thoſe where <hi>Pus</hi> will ſodainelye bréede. And ſo he going forward, ſaith, that <hi>Pus</hi> commeth through ſome putrefaction. Furthermore, that all putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commeth through moiſtures and heate, and therefore the Cataplaſmes made of Barlie meale (ſéeing that they are hot and moiſt) we will miniſter it to all diſeaſes, where it is expedient to engender <hi>Pus,</hi> for the Barlie meale with water and oyle, and likewiſe bread with oyle, or a fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of much hot water, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Malagma,</hi> called <hi>Tetraphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice,</hi> and to conclude, all things that moiſt and heat, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pus.</hi> And if in the parts where Phlegmon is, there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth pulſation, in ſuch wiſe, that there is no hope of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſaid parts, without <hi>Pus</hi> or ſuppuration, all the auncients trulie applie the ſaid medicines, and not before. The which thinges <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſheweth plainely in the wordes before rehearſed, whereby he commaundeth to vſe drie medicines to the wounded parts, where there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, but they that be with contuſion, muſt be quicklie brought to ſuppuration.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:18258:82"/>
               <p>Moreouer, when he ſaith, that all vlcers which be not wel mundified, &amp; begin againe to increaſe, in them there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſupercreſcent fleſh, but thoſe that are mundified as they ought to be, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſoone to ciccatrize, for in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſuperfluous fleſh, except there be contuſion. Of a truth, when he ſpeaketh of contuſion, he calleth to mind that which he hath ſaid before. That is, all vlcers require drie medicines, except thoſe be contuſed. For if you doe applie to the parts where as Phlegmon is, a Cataplaſma that is hot and moiſt, it is not done by the firſt and principall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is as a remedie to the affected part, but to mittigate the accidents. For the remedies of Phlegmon are of deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiue vertue. Hearken now what <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſaith: the <hi>Cataplaſmes</hi> for <hi>Oedema</hi> and <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> ought to be made of <hi>Verbeſcum</hi> ſodden, the leaues of <hi>Trifolium,</hi> &amp; the leaues of <hi>Piretron</hi> and <hi>Polium</hi> ſodden. All theſe medicaments haue vertue deſiccatiue, as we haue made mention in the booke of ſimple Medicaments.</p>
               <p>And to be ſhort, the curation of the parts where Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is, is done by kinde of theſe remedies, which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue altogether the affects. And if the ſaid remedies haue left anie thing remaining that will come to ſuppuration, it is néedfull than to haue another medicine which is more ſtrong, to make it ſooner to come to ſuppuration, or if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſkin that be about be thin, and that thou wilt that the Patient ſhall be ſooner eaſed, you muſt make inciſion. The taking awaie of Phlegmon, is by mittigation of Barlie meale, &amp; not curation, for that fighteth onelie againſt the diſeaſe, but of theſe differences we will ſpeake héereafter at large.</p>
               <p>Now I thinke we haue manifeſtlie ſhewed, how that <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> hath commaunded that all vlcers ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccated, and that he hath confirmed it to be the proper end of curation. But now in as much as the indication is taken of the affect, and not of time. If anie deſire to haue greater perſwaſion, let him diligentlie reade all the Bookes of <hi>Hyppoorates,</hi> that he hath written of Vlcers, for he ſhall perfectlie vnderſtande, that there is one Indication generall of all Vlcers, which wée
<pb facs="tcp:18258:83"/> haue ſhewed in the booke precedent, and there is no Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be taken of time, but of the affectes of the vlcers, as Phlegmon, and other ſuch like accidences, as before is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. And ſéeing now we are come to the place to ſpeake, it is a thing moſt true, that <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> hath bene the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenter, not onelie of that which we haue ſaid before, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of all other things that are to be knowen, to him that wil cure an vlcer well. It appeareth trulie that he hath inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reaſon and the manner to cure ſimple vlcers, and alſo the kindes of the affects which conſiſt in drineſſe. For either the ill humours reſort vnto the grieued part, or els they reſort no more vnto it. If they come no more, then it is requiſite to helpe and ſuccour the grieued parte, that is, if it be pale, blacke, or red, it muſt be ſcarified, that the euil bloud may come forth, then afterward becauſe that I may vſe his wordes, you muſt laie thereon a Spunge more dry than moiſt. For I doe thinke, that there is no perſon ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but will thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a drie ſpunge ought rather to be applyed than a moiſt, and alſo to vſe deſiccatiue medicines. And then if it be requiſite for to drawe bloud againe, doe as you haue done before, vntill the time that health be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether recouered. And if the lips of the vlcer appeare hard and ſtonie, they muſt be cut awaie, the which thing is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken héere.</p>
               <p>But if the vlcer that is round, be ſomewhat hollow, you muſt cut it according to the roundneſſe which is ſwollen, which ſwelling the Gréekes call <hi>Apoſtema,</hi> either all the roundneſſe, or as much as neceſſitie requireth, according to the length of the member. Alſo it is written of all Tumors againſt nature, that are ioyned with an vlcer, howe they ought to be cured. Likewiſe of the <hi>Variſes,</hi> for they be the occaſion that the vlcers be ſo ſtubburne, and hard to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if that anie humour of the ſaid <hi>Variſes</hi> do repaire vnto the vlcer. And in like manner when the fluxe of an humor commeth from all the bodie, he commandeth that all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſhalbe purged, without taking anie indication of time. Trulie it were a ridiculous thing that ſo many and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Indications ſhould be taken of one communitie. For
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18258:83"/> put we the caſe, indications to be taken of tyme. But if we graunt that time giueth a certaine indication, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to aſke what indication it giueth, and compriſe it in a ſumme, as <hi>Theſſalians</hi> doth, which taketh indication of a bodie that is bound, that that may bée vnlooſed againe, and that bodie that hath a lax, is to bée ſtopped. Likewiſe in vlcers that are filthie, mundification is to be required, and thoſe that be holow, to be filled with fleſh, and thoſe that be equall to be ciccatrized, &amp; that which hath ſuperfluous fleſh, to be taken away. <hi>Theſſalus</hi> himſelfe is author of theſe: but now let him ſhew that ther is any indication proportioned to the time of the vlcer, as there is in all theſe that we haue rehearſed, which is not poſſible for him: for he biddeth that they ſhould be cut, and a <hi>Malagma,</hi> made of Muſtardſéede to be applied vnto it.</p>
               <p>I praye you what reaſonable indication hath he taken now of time, which taketh and vſurpeth this vaine woord <hi>Metaſincriſis,</hi> and after that he prouoketh vomit by <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and then when he findeth no other remedie, he vſeth <hi>Eliber,</hi> and when theſe nothing profit, he ſendeth the pacient lyke a wyſe Phiſition into <hi>Libia,</hi> for chaunge of ayre, the which things ſhal be more plainly ſpoken of hereafter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall ſhew that indication in what diſeaſe ſo euer it be, ſhall be taken of time. Yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhall be good to know the diuturnitie of the diſeaſe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt I wil returne to <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> whome I doe greatly maruail at, not onely for his diligence, but alſo for al other things, &amp; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that he hath not forgotten that which is to be conſidered of all Phiſitions as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the indications of all diſeaſes. That is to ſay, the indicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is taken of the greatneſſe and magnitude of the affect, which not onely the Methodicians haue permitted (this is to be maruailed at) but alſo many of the Rationales, yea, and of the Emperickes, although it
<pb facs="tcp:18258:84"/> be after another ſort. For when they ſay that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the euacuation in the courſe of the bloud, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe then manifeſtly, that they haue no regarde of other things that appeare in the affected part, for to come to ſuch euacuation. But I doe not ſay thus, that purgation is eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, the which is no indication of the courſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud, but for bicauſe wée muſt ſometime haue conſideration to the letting forth of bloud, although there be no courſe of bloud preſent, which may flow to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greued part: for when the diſeaſe is very ſtrong, there is none which vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the arte of medicine, but will let bloud. And truely the Emperickes themſelues, let bloud when any is fallen from an high place, or when there is any part ſore bruſed &amp; hurt with any wound, though the pacient were whole and ſound before, and without ſuperfluitie of bloud. By the which it appeareth, that it is not the flowing of the bloud to the affected parte, which giueth indication, but the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of the diſeaſe &amp; the force of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthes, excepting yet from our talke, children. As for example. If a man be whole and ſound, and without any maner of hurt, and hauing abundance of bloud, it is not neceſſarie becauſe of his abundance to take his bloud from him. For there is no indication to be taken of the bloud, for becauſe the man is whole, for to ſuch men faſting doth profit, &amp; ſmall eating, and ſometime Purgation or bathing and Frications may ſuffiſe. Letting of bloud is not neceſſary to ſuch, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perickes ſay.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe Purgation is not good in the onely abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of humours, for euen as letting of bloud is done either for abundance of bloud or for the magnitude of the diſeaſe, ſo is purgation giuen either for the abundaunce of ill humours or for the force of the diſeaſe. As touching letting of bloud we haue ſpoken of in another booke, and ſhall doe againe hereafter. But in this preſent booke I will ſpeake of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for they that be diſeaſed, require them, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth euacuate the noyſome and ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with the which the bodie is grieued, but alſo put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorth and clenſeth the excrements within the bodie.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:18258:84"/>
               <p>And for this cauſe <hi>Hyppocates</hi> as well in his other works as in that he hath written of Vlcers, conſidereth the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and ſtrength of the diſeaſe, whereof he taketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of purging, and ſayth thus.</p>
               <p>Purgations of the bellie is profitable to many Vlcers, and alſo to woundes of the head, of the bellie, and of the ioynts, and where there is daunger of the rottenneſſe of the bones, or where ſtitching behoueth in woundes, or where eroſions bée, or where <hi>Herpis</hi> &amp; other affects be, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the curation of Vlcers, and alſo where rolling muſt be vſed.</p>
               <p>By theſe words it is apparant truelie, that Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are profitable both to wounds and Vlcers, at all times when they be great and grieuous. For not onelie the ſayd affects, but other bée made great and grieuous, thrée man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies, that is, either through the excellencie of the afflicted part, either elſe through the greatneſſe of the affect, or elſe becauſe the ſaid affects are <hi>Cacoethae</hi> (that is to ſaie, hard to be cured.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> hath made mention of all theſe thinges perticularlie, when he dyd intreate of woundes of the head and bellie, and of the excellencie and dignitie of hurt parts. I thinke it is manifeſt to all men, that he muſt bée vnderſtoode, not onelie the lower bellie, but alſo the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, for in diuiding the Trunke of mannes bodie, which is betwixt the necke and the legges, is two greate capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>
               <p>The firſt is contained vnder the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and aboue <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the ſecond vnder <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> vnto <hi>Os Pubi,</hi> or to <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> which couereth the inwarde parte of the bellie. And for certaine, thoſe woundes which hath pearced within the <hi>Thorax</hi> or within <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> is verie dangerous, chiefelie if anie of the inward parts bée woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Likewiſe there are verie fewe, but they doe know that the woundes of the ioyntes are <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> and are harde to bée cured: Which thinges the Emperikes vnderſtand onelie by experience, and they that haue ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and haue attained to the knowledge of mannes bodie,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:85"/> vnderſtand theſe thinges by the nature of the hurt parte. For in tendonie and ſinnowie parts, where bones are void of fleſh, there is great daunger of paine, waking, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of reſt, and alſo of conuulſion. Such woundes as theſe be, and ſuch as be ſtitched, that is to ſaie, thoſe that are ſo great that they néed ſtitching, or at the leſt, of binding or rolling, requireth purgation.</p>
               <p>We haue declared in the laſt booke, that all the greater wounds ought to be ioyned together, either by ſtitching or by binding. Likewiſe the vlcers where there is daunger of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bones, are oftentimes ioyned with great inflamations. Alſo they that procéede of ill humours, bée <hi>Cachoethae,</hi> and with eroſion. Alſo <hi>Herpetes</hi> come of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerike humours, and all other olde vlcers come of ſuch like cauſe. Wherefore in all the vlcers before eſpecified, <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> commandeth to purge by the bellie, and afterward he addeth theſe wordes. In all vlcers whereto Eriſipel as is come, the bodie muſt be purged in that part moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the vlcer, ſo that the purgation be made either by the vpper partes or elſe by the lower, which difference hée hath ſet forth in the booke of Humours, where he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to tourne awaie the humour to the contrarie parte. As for example. There is a great flux that commeth to one part of the bodie where there is an vlcer, it behoueth to make another in the contrarie parts, and thereof he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſaid booke.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if there be as yet a great fluxe which dooth runue to the ſore part, we ſhall make reuulſion to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie part: that is to ſaie, if the vlcer be in the vpper parts, by purging downward, and if it be in the neather partes, by purging the vpper ventricle. But if the fluxe bée newe ſtopped in ſuch ſorte that is fixed in the member, it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to driue it out by the next partes, ſéeing that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages be the next places, ſéeing that the acceſſe and attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of purging medicines is more eaſie and prompt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue thoſe things that be néere, rather than thoſe thinges that be farre of, the which reaſon belongeth to another part of the art, which entreateth of purging medicines, therfore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18258:85"/> hereafter it ſhall be declared and made perfect.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſhew the force, or if you will call it the magnitude of the diſeaſe, to be appointed for a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of taking away bloud or giuing purgation. And alſo that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> was the firſt inuenter of the ſayd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, I will ſpeake in the bookes following of diſeaſes, and in this booke I will ſpeake of vlcers. I haue alreadie ſpoken of Purgations. For ſéeing that euery diſeaſe is gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous thrée maner of wayes, it is either for the excellencie and nobleneſſe of the part, or for the magnitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affect, or for the frowardneſſe of the ſame affect, called in Gréeke <hi>Cacoethia. Hippocrates</hi> hath made mencion of all theſe things where he ſpeaketh of Purgations. But ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce will ſay, How then? doth not <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> councell vs to take away the bloud for theſe cauſes aboue eſpecified? By my iudgement he commaundeth them thus, but in few wordes, and that not without demonſtration, as he and all the auncients were accuſtomed to doe. Thou ſhalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it is ſo, if that thou wilt reade againe his words, that are theſe. In euery freſh wound, except it be in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is expedient to let bloud flow out of it, more or leſſe. For by that meanes the wound ſhall be leſſe grieuous, the inflamation leſſe, and all the places about it. But if thou ſhalt remember hereafter thoſe wordes that he writ when he did entreate if vlcers and alſo thoſe thinges that he hath propounded in all his other bookes, that is to ſay, how that a Phiſition ought to be an imitator and follower, not onely of nature, but alſo of thoſe things which ſhalbe profitable, when they come to their naturall ſtate. Then thou ſhalt plainly vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the minde of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and alſo how that bloud ought to be drawen when wounds be great: but if out of ſuch wounds bloud doth not flow, eſpecially when as it is a thing moſt conuenient, then thou muſt adde and ſupply thoſe thinges that be néedefull and neceſſarie. The matter that followeth, he conioyneth it with that which is aboueſayde.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is profitable that from inueterate vlcers, bloud doe flow, and alſo from the parts which are about them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:86"/>
               <p>But foraſmuch as he hath ſaid before, that bloud ſhould flow from euery gréene wound, except that he made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion now of inueterate vlcers, it would ſéeme to ſome that he dyd entreate onely of greene and freſh wounds. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did well adde this, (that is to ſay) how that it is a thing moſt méete to draw bloud from inueterate vlcers.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now ſeeing that the doctrine which we haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him is true and firme: that is to ſay, how a flux be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the contrary parts, ought to be drawen, &amp; how that which is alreadie fixed in the partie, ought to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, either from the payned part, or from the part next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: therefore it is now eaſie for vs to conclude of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of bloud, how that in the beginning it ought to be done in the part farre of, and then in the vlcerate parts.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if you doe adde vnto theſe which I haue before ſpoken, how that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelleth to euacuate the ſuperfluous humour, and that detraction of bloud ought to be vſed when it ſurmounteth, and that a medicament ought to be giuen, which hath vertue to purge humours Chollerike, Melancholicke, and Phlegmatike: Yet haue in remembraunce all theſe woords, how that none of them is the curation of vlcers, no not ſo much as of an vlcer, but rather of <hi>Cacochimia,</hi> that is coniunct with the vlcer, or of <hi>Plethor,</hi> or of <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> or of <hi>Herpis,</hi> or other like diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Neither yet be not forgetfull of this thing, that is to ſay, that none of the accidents of the vlcer giueth ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per indication, as magnitude. In the booke precedent, we haue intreated of vlcers, wherein we haue declared all the differences of vlcers, how many, and what they be, &amp; what is the indication of either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit, I haue not ſpp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſaide booke, how the indication of purging is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the vehemencie of the diſeaſe, bicauſe it ſhould not be to much prolixitie &amp; demonſtration. Neither in the ſaide booke, I haue connixed the curation of all the bodie with the vlcers, but yet I haue declared in this preſent booke, in as much as it was agréeable and vtill for my purpoſe.</p>

In like maner, the indication which is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age, &amp; that which is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of purging humours. Likewiſe the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which is taken of the afflicted parts, ſhal be declared in the bookes which follow. But as yet we haue onlie made mention of the curatiue Indication that may be taken of the nature of the ſaid parts, that is to ſaie, of temperance &amp; ſubſtance. But trulie we haue nothing touched the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is taken of the ſcituation &amp; figure of the partes. Therefore we will ſpeake of the indications that be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the curation of Vlcers. The part trulie that hath ſharpe and quicke ſenſes, ought as much as is poſſible to be cured without dolour or paine. But the <hi>Anodinon</hi> of ſuch remedies is ſpoken of in the Booke which entreateth of the ſimple medicaments.</p>
               <p>But he that hath but ſmall ſenſes, and thoſe that be not quicke, may (if the diſeaſe require) ſuffer ſtrong medicines. But we muſt haue regard and conſideration to the ſtrength of the principall member, whereof we will more copiouſlie héereafter declare, when as we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake of Phlegmon. But if it be not a principall member, ſurelie without daunger you may miniſter vnto it ſuch medicines as mittigate and aſſwage, the Gréeks call them <hi>Calaſticke,</hi> whereof we will plainlie and more at large declare héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. At this preſent we will declare the indication which is taken of the ſcituation and figure of the partes, and then we wil finiſh and conclude this fourth booke. For this cauſe haue we excogitated and inuented certaine medicines that muſt be giuen to him that hath his ventricle vlcerate, the which medicines muſt be dronken at once, but to him that hath his throate vlcerate, they muſt be miniſtered
<pb facs="tcp:18258:87"/> at ſundry times by little and little, becauſe of the paſſing which bringeth great vtilitie to the vlcer, neither they muſt be miniſtred ſo, &amp; in ſuch caſe, as to him that hath his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle vlcerate.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe we haue declared by the ſituation and figure of the ſaid part, that ſuch medicines ought to be made groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and thick, &amp; more clammy than the other, becauſe that the throte is a paſſage of things that is eaten and dronken. And for that cauſe remedies which may conioyne &amp; cleane on euerie ſide of it, is moſt conuenient, and not ſuch as are thinne and eaſie to ſlide away. For the thicke are alwaies about the parts, and the clammy doe cleaue vnto it. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vlcers that are in the thick inteſtines, haue more néede of medicines which are caſt out by the fundament, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they be next vnto it. But the vlcers that are in the thin inteſtines, becauſe they be fardeſt from the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, require both medicines, that is to ſay, thoſe that are receued by the mouth, and thoſe that are caſt in by the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament. Now truly the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon indication of all the interior parts is, that we ought to chooſe things that be moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the nature of man, be they meates or medicaments, and to eſchew thoſe things which be contrarie vnto it.</p>
               <p>Although to Vlcers which bée in the outwarde partes, the vſe of ſuch medicaments be not hurtfull, as <hi>Aerugo, aes Vſtum, aeris Squa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma, Cadmia, Pomphilix, Litarge</hi> &amp; <hi>Ceruſſa.</hi> Yet they ought not to be miniſtred to the vlcers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, of whoſe nature we haue written in the booke of temperaments, and in the booke of ſimple medicines.</p>
               <p>But if we go about to glutinate the vlcer, and bring it to a ciccatriſe, we muſt chooſe glutinatiue medicines, &amp; ſuch as will not cauſe eroſion. But if we will clenſe the vlcer, we muſt vſe things abſterſiue, and ſuch as wil abſterge it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, as raw Honey, which of al things for this purpoſe is the chiefeſt.</p>
               <p>But as touching adſtingent potions called <hi>Auſterae,</hi> and other ſuch like alimentes, they be knowen vnto all men. This woord <hi>Auſter,</hi> is called <hi>Stiphos</hi> in Gréeke, that is to ſay, little aſtringent, and that which is lower or bitter, is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18258:87"/> called in Gréeke <hi>Striphnon.</hi> But the medicines which may be taken without danger, are ſpoken of in the booke of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. Neuertheleſſe I wil ſhew ſome forme of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Medicaments for the inward vlcers, which are theſe, namelie, <hi>Hipocyſtis, Balauſtium, Cytini Punicorum, Galla, Malicorium, Terra Samia, Lemnium Sigillum, Roſarum Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Acacia,</hi> &amp; other or like kinde, which be profitable for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vlcers, and you muſt miniſter the ſaid medicaments with ſome decoction of adſtringent things, as of Quinces, Lentiſke, or the tops of <hi>Rubus,</hi> or of Vines, or gréene mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills, or with adſtringent Wine. It is now manifeſt, and I thinke none is ſo ignorant, but will iudge that hée muſt eſchue drinking of wine if there be Phlegmon, or elſe there is no daunger.</p>
               <p>In like maner it is euident that the ſaid Medicaments muſt be prepared &amp; receiued with decoction of moiſt things. Alſo you muſt mixe gumme <hi>Tragacanthen</hi> in thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which are for the vlcers in <hi>Gula,</hi> you muſt vſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſes in the Vlcers that are in the partes called <hi>Fauces</hi> and <hi>Pariſthmia,</hi> but if the vlcer bée in <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Trachia,</hi> then the Patient muſt be layed vpright, and kéepe the medicine long time in his mouth, in looſing all the muſcles that be in that place, for in ſo dooing ſome part of medicament will flow by little and little to the grieued parte. For when the ſayde <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> is in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtate, or in good health, then we may eaſilie know when anie potion paſſeth through it. For like as we muſt take heede when as it is in good health, leaſt anie fluxe fall that waie which maye hurt it: ſo in like manner we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware when it is grieued, leaſt anie thing doe fall that waie which may prouoke the cough: then it ſéemeth that the Indications of it are taken of the ſcituation and forme of the part.</p>
               <p>Alſo Honie muſt be mingled in all Medicaments which are ordained for the Vlcer in the <hi>Thorax</hi> and Lungs. Therefore if we vſe aſtringent medicines, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the bellie. Then the inſtrument which is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the digeſtion and diſtribution of the ſaid medicame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
<pb facs="tcp:18258:88"/> ouer all the bodie ſhal be honie. Alſo it being mingled with the ſaid medicines, ſhall be occaſion of their quicke paſſage ouer the bodie, neither ſhall it anie thing anoie or hurt the vlcer. In like manner if there be an vlcer in the bladder &amp; in the raines, honie and ſuch as prouoketh vrine muſt bée mingled with the ſaid medicines. But I thinke that it is apparant to all men, though they take not me the author of the ſame, how that the vlcerate partes may be diſcerned or knowen by their ſubſtance, action, vtilitie, ſcituation, and figure. The which things trulie haue ben amplie declared in the booke which entreateth of the ſignes of the affected parts, but now there is no time to talke of them, therefore I will returne to the method of curation. Alſo I ſaie and affirme, that not onelie theſe aboue rehearſed, but alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, be the indications of the figure, and ſcituation of the partes. For you cannot well and exactlie binde the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected part, before ye take indication either of the figure, or ſcituation, or of them both. Neither can you ſet the pipe of a cliſter well, before ye take ſuch Indication. What ſhould I make mention of <hi>Argalia,</hi> ſpeciallie when as you cannot miniſter it before you perfectlie knowe the ſcituation and figure of the bladder. Then trulie by theſe things it dooth manifeſtlie appeare, that the affected part giueth indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the curation. But in ruptures truelie, which the Gréekes call <hi>Regmata,</hi> many Indications may be taken to one purpoſe, and principallie the indication that is taken of the ſcituation ought to be conſidered. For the ruptions that be hid in the deapth of the bodie, require other curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than the woundes which appeare outwardlie, and for becauſe they be ſuch as be with <hi>Ecchimoſis,</hi> or contuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the broken fleſh, therefore they declare diuerſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations curatiue. For alwaies the Indications curatiue do anſwere to the number of the affects, wherof we wil ſhew more copiouſlie heereafter, when we ſhall ſpeake of Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, how that the affects that are in the déepe places of the bodie, requireth ſtronger medicines than thoſe in the vpper parts. Then at the leaſt I iudge it to be manifeſt, that it is neceſſarie that the ſtrength of the medicamentes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18258:88"/> that are miniſtred outwardlie ought to be reſolued, when the affected part which ſhould be cured by thoſe, is hid in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deapth and profunditie of the bodie. Therefore it behoueth to augment the vertue of the ſame medicaments, ſo that by the paſſage thereof it may be ſtaked. Certainlie <hi>Ecchimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> doth indicate euacuation for the remedie of the cure. Wherefore medicamentes that will moderatlie heate and drie, be moſt conuenient for it. For they that do vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie drie, trulie do reſolue and digeſt more at the beginning than they which drie but ſimplie. But I will ſpeake héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſomewhat of this diſeaſe, which is difficill and ſerious to cure. But of that which did pertaine to the matter wee haue largelie ſpoken of. Truelie thoſe medicamentes that moiſteth and heateth more than they, which the Gréekes call <hi>Calaſticke.</hi> Alſo thoſe which doe ſomewhat to drineſſe, which the Gréekes call <hi>Suntatica,</hi> be the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall remedies for all <hi>Ecchimoſis.</hi> But we muſt take héede the medicines do cleaue to the ruptions that are in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the bodie, and alſo that they be of ſtrong vertue, &amp; that they be ſharpe and ſuch as will digeſt: and to ſpeake brieflie, ſuch medicines ought to be of great force, inaſmuch as <hi>Ecchimoſis</hi> is in the déepneſſe of the bodie and far from the ſkin. In ſuch affects the vſe of a cucurbite is profitable, which is an inſtrument inuented of Phiſitions, to cauſe vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate attraction. And when <hi>Ecchimoſis</hi> is digeſted by the vſe of a cucurbit, then you may miniſter thoſe things which may drie the broken fleſh, and conioyne it with ligature, &amp; adde that which may coagulate and ioyne the wounde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for <hi>Ecchimoſis</hi> being reſolued and digeſted, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fleſh ſhall coagulate together. But if it be reſolued, then corruption bréedeth in it, and occupieth the ſpace that is betwéene the lippes of the wounde, ſo that the ruption cannot cloſe. Wherefore theſe aboue rehearſed, declare vnto vs all cauſes howe ſmall ſo euer they bée.</p>
               <p>For although ſome hath had rigour, or though the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hath béene ouerthrowen by ſome Feauer, ſo that there bath not bene good concoction, or that it hath béene
<pb facs="tcp:18258:89"/> defatigated and wearied, then immediatlie there ſhall bée paine in the part where the ruption and wound is, becauſe that the ſaid ruption hath bene latelie ioyned together, but not ſo ſubſtantiallie, becauſe of time. Wherfore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that a little thing may eaſilie part them, &amp; fil the place againe with ſuperfluous humours. But what engendereth in ſuch wounds or ruptions? nothing but new <hi>Ecchimoſis,</hi> and much like vnto the firſt: That is to ſaie, when the fleſh was firſt broken, except that this <hi>Ecchimoſis</hi> that is new, of more and corrupter mattier than that which was at the beginning, which came of bloud, and therefore now this is more eaſilie digeſted and reſolued than that which was at the beginning. And thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we haue ſpoken hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhall ſuffice for the diſputation of Vlcers, &amp; thus we conclude this fourth Booke of our The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeutike methode, called <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Medendi.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing that in the two laſt bookes we haue taught how anie ſhall rightlie cure Vlcers, we will by the waie ſhew, that all other Phiſitions which vſe the arte, not ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Elementes of thoſe ſimple par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in vs, cannot cure anie thing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by reaſon, but yet leaſt of all other thoſe which profeſſe <hi>Theſſalus</hi> doctrine. The reſt which are by méere experience onelie taught, ſuppoſe, that at the leaſt thoſe Vlcers which are in diuerſe partes, are to bée cured by diuerſe reaſons. But thoſe that followe <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> (as their Captaine) for his excellent wiſedome, thinke that euerie Vlcer, in what parte of the bodie ſo euer it bée, requireth like curation: for if it bée hollowe, they ſaie it muſt bée filled with fleſh, if it bée equall, then to bée ciccatrized, if there bée ſupercreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fleſh, then that fleſh muſt bée diminiſhed, if it bée blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and new, then it muſt bée adglutinated: As though he that knew this, muſt of force cure rightlie, or that this reaſon were vnknowen to the common people, when as there is none that is héerein ignoraunt. But they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not howe the hollowneſſe is to bée filled with fleſh, neither howe that which is filled ought to bée ciccatrized, or to take awaie that is ouermuch encreaſed, or to ioyne together that which is pure and bloudie without hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſuch workes trulie are properlie appertaining to the art of Medicine, found out by the helpe either of Reaſon or Experience, or both.</p>
               <p>Therefore repeating againe, let vs briefelie ouer-runne thoſe things, wherby the beginning of theſe which are to be ſpoken, may be ioyned with the aid of thoſe which we haue alreadie ſet out. Wée haue declared that euerie Vlcer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth deſiccatiue medicines, but that which hath hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, beſide that, it needeth deſiccatiues, it alſo doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire abſterſiues: that which requireth to haue the lippes ioyned together, (ſuch is a gréene wound, called in Gréeke
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18258:90"/> 
                  <hi>Enema</hi>) doth aſke both more drying medicines, and alſo that be gentle aſtringent without anie abſterſion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, thoſe vlcers which néede to bée ciccatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, require not onelie yet more drying medicines, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtrong aſtringent remedies, and whereas there is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percreſcent fleſh againſt nature, there are required ſharpe and abating medicines, ſuch of neceſſitie bée hot and drie. If anie accident bée ioyned with the Vlcer, the Indication of curation muſt bée taken of the nature thereof, and of this all the faculties of medicines alſo to bée had. If there ſhould ſuperfluous mattier growe in the Vlcer, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to haue medicines which ſhould take it awaie, and ſuch haue a greate deale more abſterſiue vertue than ſome incarnatiue medicines haue.</p>
               <p>Alſo if there bée ſéene more copious moiſture, there is néede of a medicine more deſiccatiue, but yet not to exceede his kinde, and if the medicine ſhoulde be glutinatiue, it ought to bée drying and aſtringent, if it ſhall incarnate, it muſt be deſiccatiue, and ſome thing abſterſiue, and ſo in all other, as is alreadie declared. Alſo if the fleſh ſubiect ſhould be intemperate, firſt truelie we muſt cure this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperatneſſe, that which is drier, by medicines humectiue, the moiſt, by deſiccatiues. Alſo that which is hot by refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geratiues, the colde, by medicines that are hot. And if by coniunction of two qualities, the fleſh bée intemperate, it muſt be cured by miniſtring a contrarie medicine, which hath double qualities, for this one thing is common to all affects againſt nature, that they cannot come againe to their owne nature, without ſuch medicines as haue contrarie qualitie.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, at this time the cauſes of theſe intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues are to be conſidered, whether theſe be common to all the whole bodie, or elſe proper of ſome partes, which ſhould infeſt the vlcerate member by ſocietie, the Gréekes call it <hi>Simpathia.</hi> Firſt of all trulie, the cauſe that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this intemperatneſſe, is to be cured, and after that the intemperatneſſe it ſelfe which is now made, for this indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is common to all ſuch as ſpring of anie cauſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:91"/>
               <p>We haue alſo declared that there are diuerſe indications taken of the differences of vlcers, and alſo thoſe which are taken of the temparament of the ſicke bodie, haue a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reaſon, for thoſe Indications ſéeing they are taken of thoſe things which are againſt nature, declare that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie things muſt be applied: theſe Indications becauſe they are taken of natures ſelfe, ſhew that like things muſt be vſed, for if how much the part is drier, ſo much the more it requireth to be dried, that which is leſſe drie, is leſſe to bée dried. In like ſort trulie it is declared in making hot or colde. Neither haue we let paſſe that of the excellencie of the member or contrarie ſtate. Alſo to the ſharpneſſe or dulneſſe of féeling, there is to bée had a contrarie ſcope of curing.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Herefore we will now conſider that which remaineth of the curation of this kinde of infirmities, we call this kinde, for more euident doctrines ſake, ſolution of vnitie, neither is it anie matter, if thou call it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuitie. This kinde doth not onelie happen in the ſimiler and ſimple partes, but alſo in the compound and inſtrumentall, but yet there be other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of remedies taken of the ſimiler partes, then of the Inſtrumentall of which they that follow <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> methode, know both, becauſe they know the natures of both partes. But thoſe that follow <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> and <hi>Herophilus,</hi> haue but one Indication, that is to ſaie, that which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Inſtrumentall partes. Wherefore they haue no certaine method in theſe, which follow whatſoeuer indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are taken of the bodie, or ſickneſſe, hot, colde, moiſt, or drie, but yet they are not ignorant of the Indications ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the forme, poſition, excellencie, quicke féeling of the part, or thoſe which are contrarie. That which we ſaie ſhal be more manifeſt if we ſet out the the partes themſelues. Therefore becauſe alreadie abundantlie we haue entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of thoſe Vlcers, chieflie which happen in the fleſhie
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18258:91"/> partes, it is time to ſpeake of them which chaunce in the veine, and arterie, and nerue, and not of theſe abſolutelie by themſelues, but as they are in the inſtrumentall partes of man. Wherefore if anie hath a greate arterie or veine wounded, &amp; there followeth preſentlie great flux of bloud, and the wound in the veine will hardlie be glutinated in the arterie, it can more hardlie be done, as many Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuppoſe, but peraduenture cannot be done at all. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt againe ſpeake of either of them, and firſt of the fluxe of bloud, and next of adglutination. But for that ſuch fluxes are cauſed by <hi>Anaſtomaſin</hi> and <hi>Diepedeſin,</hi> as we preſentlie declare, it ſhall not be from our purpoſe, for that they both haue a common cure, to make mention of them in this place, although they ſéeme to be another kinde of diſeaſe, trulie the bloud floweth out of the veine or arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the mouth of them being opened, or their coate diuided, or as I may tearme it, ſtrained or ſent out in manner of ſweate, ſurelie the coate of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is diuided either by woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or contuſion, or ruption, or eroſion. <hi>Anaſtomaſis</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, both through the imbecilitie of the veſſels, and alſo through the plentie of bloud which breaketh to the mouth of it with violence, &amp; furthermore by anie thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mming outwardlie, hauing a ſharpe qualitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diapedeſis</hi> commeth when as the coate is made more thin, and the bloud attenuated, and furthermore, it maye come to the mouth of anie of the ſmall veines béeing opened. Therefore we muſt ſpeake of either affect by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and firſt of all of that diuiſion which we haue ſayd to come of eroſion or wounding, or contuſion, or ruption, ſo that thoſe things which doe wound are edged tooles, and apt to cutte, thoſe that make contuſion are heauie and harde, thoſe that cauſe ruption, doe it by ſtraining, the ſame doth alſo the vehemencie of anie action, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ill iuyce or humours, not in reſpect of the ſtrength, but for that it is not contained in his veſſells.</p>
               <p>Alſo anie heauie or hard thing falling from aboue, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in, for anie ſuch thing when the veſſels or veines are emptie, or elſe containing but a ſmall ſubſtaunce entering
<pb facs="tcp:18258:92"/> in it, if it hath an obiect which is hard, it cauſeth contuſion, if the veſſell be full, it bruſeth it, before it maketh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tuſion. When that which happeneth is like, as if thou diddeſt fill a bottle or bladder, and diddeſt let a ſtone fall on it, or elſe violently diddeſt ſtrike it againſt a ſtone, truely the like to this is that which happeneth to falles from aboue, for looke what reſpects the bottle hath to the ſtone, the ſame hath the man vnto the ground, and whoſoeuer breaketh any veſſells of the lungs, with great and moſt vehement clamour, muſt refer the ill receiued, vnto the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the action. In like manner he which hath broke any veſſells (that is to ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny veine or arterie) by bearing a great burden, or by going about to lift it on his ſhoulder, or elſe to lift it vp with his hands, &amp; ſo much the rather, to whome it happeneth of moſt ſwift running, or moſt ſtrong leaping, or otherwiſe, any part being violently extended. For it is like as if one ſhould ſtretch out a rope, or leather, though many veſſelles are broken becauſe they containe not the bloud in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is flatulent, as may appeare both in hogs-heads which full of muſt, doe oftentimes breake, &amp; alſo in other of moſt ſtrong bodies.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND if the veſſell be ruptured, either of wounding, clamour, fall, or contuſion, the cauſe of theſe truely doe ceaſe, but if it come of aboundance, it may againe happen that the veſſell may be ruptured, the efficient cauſe is yet remayning, &amp; alſo in this affect, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abundance truly is to be euacuated, then the bloud to be ſuppreſſed, and after the vlcer to be cured, but where as the efficient cauſe is ceaſſed, there the bloud is firſt to be ſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and after the vlcer is to be cured. How therefore, will we ſtench the bloud? truely by ſtopping the ruptured veſſel, the bloud that was caryed by it being auerted and conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another place, for if the bloud ſhould be caried to the place vnto which it dyd in the beginning flow, and that the

Neither is it lawfull to ſtitch the wound of a veine or arterie, as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, who ſaie that no Indication is to be taken of the ſubſtance and nature of the wounded part, the mouth of the veſſell ſhall be ſtopped, the bloud being then coniealed, the Gréekes call it <hi>Thombros,</hi> and alſo by things outwardlie applied on both ſides about, may be put vpon it, and alſo in many wounds the ſkin it ſelfe, or what elſe we mixt with it, ſuch are linaments, in Gréeke called <hi>Motos,</hi> &amp; thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, becauſe they haue a clammie and groſe ſubſtance, doe ſtoppe the pores, the Gréekes name them <hi>Emphlaſtica,</hi> as alſo medicines which make a cruſt, which the Gréekes name <hi>Eſcharan.</hi> The olde Phiſitions deſpiſed theſe in ſuch like wounds, as it were a great ieopardie. Theſe alſo are done, not onelie by the fire it ſelfe, but alſo with medicines hauing a firie facultie, and the mouth of the veſſell is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by theſe medicines, the bloud trulie ſhall be auerted and turned to other members, both béeing drawen vnto the next partes, and alſo by reuulſion to the contrarie, the Gréekes call that <hi>Parochetenſis,</hi> but this <hi>Stuti Paſis,</hi> and theſe alſo bée inuented of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> being verilie the common remedies of all immoderate euacuation. Deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made vnto the next parts, when as that which is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is euacuated by the noſethrilles. Alſo reuulſion to the contrarie partes, is when as it draweth downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Againe, that which floweth by ſtoole, that is deriued by the womans ſhape, but Reuulſion is vpwarde, for ſo truelie Nature is woont to doe. To the woman, ſayth <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> which vomiteth bloud, her naturall ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe following is a remedie, &amp; for this cauſe if her tearmes abundantlie break out, or that bloud by anie waie floweth
<pb facs="tcp:18258:93"/> out of the matrice, thou ſhalt drawe it vpward by fixing a great cucurbite or boxe vnder the paps. For this alſo is inuented of <hi>Hyppocrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by like reaſon the bléeding at the noſe is ſtayed by great cucurbites fixed vnder the ribs, and if it floweth out of the right noſethrill, then the cucurbite is to be ſet vpon the liuer, but if it commeth out of the left noſethrill, then ſet cucurbite vpon the ſplene, but if the bloud floweth out of both noſethrills, then fixe the cucurbits vpon both liuer and ſplene, but if the patient be not yet holpen, open a veine on the cubite that is right againſt the fluxe, and when as thou haſt taken a little bloud awaie, ſtop it for an houres ſpace, and then take againe more bloud, and ſo againe and againe, according to the ſtrength of the Patient. In like ſort, becauſe it is a common waie of curing, thou ſhalt bring all other fluxes both to their contrarie parts, and alſo make deriuation by the next places, for that which floweth by the ſtoole, to euacuate by vrine or the matrice, and that which floweth by vrine muſt be voided by ſtoole or matrice. And of the fluxes of the Eies, Eares, and pallet of the mouth, the next doriuation is by the noſethrils, reuulſion trulie of all theſe higher parts, is euer to be made downward, and alſo of the lower parts vpward. Alſo from the right ſide to the left, as alſo from the left ſide to the right. In like ſorte reuulſion of that which is within muſt be made outward, and of that which is outward in like ſort inward, therfore friction of contrarie parts is done chieflie by thoſe medicines which doe heate.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſtraight ligatures are to be reckoned among thoſe remedies which bring to the contrarie partes, and ſo alſo is the ſhutting of the naturall pores ſet in the oppoſite place, but by what medicines that ſhall be done, the matter thereof is ſet out in our bookes of Medicines. But it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to intreate of all Fluxes in the Bookes following. Now we muſt returne vnto the flux of bloud, and the band put on the veſſells that flowe, are to be accounted among ſtopping medicines, and alſo our fingers, which do cloſe and preſſe the veſſels.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:18258:93"/>
               <p>There is alſo another ligature hereto appertaining, which the Gréekes call <hi>Epideſis,</hi> although it goeth not rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about the member, as a bande doth, but ioyneth the gaping lips of the wounded part by his embracing, &amp; alſo holdeth ſuch things as are put vpon the parte, and is numbred among cloſing medicines. Beſides all theſe rehearſed, the apt ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the wounded part, is accompted among the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which ſtay the flux of bloud.</p>
               <p>Surely the ſituation ſhall be apt, if it be directed vnto theſe two endes, that the part be frée from dolor, and be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vpward, for if the part hang downe or is pained, it will not ſtaye the fluxe, but will cauſe it, if there be none. Therefore he that knoweth theſe things, if at any time he ſhall ſtand by him out of whoſe wound bloud floweth, (for firſt I will entreate of theſe,) let him put his finger vpon the mouth of the veſſell gently, ſtrayning it and compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it without dolor, for ſo he ſhall at once both ſtaye the bloud, &amp; alſo make it congele in the wound, but if the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from which it floweth, be déepe hid, let him then ſurely both know the poſition and magnitude of it. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, whether it be a veine or arterie, then put it in a hooke and lyft it vp, and a little wryth it, but if the bloud will not ſo be ſtayed, if it be a veine let him without bynding, aſſay it, to ſtench the bloud with ſome of thoſe medicines which haue power to ſtay bloud, truely the beſt are thoſe Emplaſtique which are made of Roſin fryed, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt wheate flowre, and Gipſum, and ſuch lyke, but if it be an arterie, thou ſhalt ſtay the flux with one of theſe two, either by binding it, or by cutting a ſunder the whole veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and ſometime truely we are alſo conſtrained to bynde the great veines, and to cut all theſe ouerthwart, and this neceſſitie happeneth in thoſe where as the fluxe iſſueth out of the déepeſt place, &amp; chiefely by thoſe parts that be ſtraight and principall, for ſo is part of the other part drawen back, and the wound is hid and couered of the parts lying on it, but it is more ſafetie to doe both, that is, to binde the roote of the veſſell, and alſo to cut of that remaineth, I call the roote of the veſſel his former part, which is néerer the liuer,

               <p>This medicine (as I haue ſaide,) I vſe many waies, ſometime to the Aloes, the double waight of Franconcenſe, ſometime equall portion of both, ſometime the Francon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to be a little more than the Aloes, or elſe a greater portion, but not double, and ſometime putting in the ſtead of Franconcenſe, Manna, for Manna is a medicine that is more reſtringent than Franconcenſe, and Franconcenſe is more Emplaſtique than manna, and it is manifeſt that in hard bodies there muſt be the more portion of Aloes, as in ſoft more of Franconcenſe, ſo ſhall the one of them be more aſtringent, and the other by his cla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mineſſe and groſſeneſſe, cleauing more to the ſmall pores, which they call <hi>Emplaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coteron,</hi> therefore where thou wilt ſtudie to make the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine more Emplaſtique, it behoueth that thou vſe thoſe Franconcenſe that be tough, and as I may terme it, more Roſin lyke, ſuch truely is ſofter and whiter, and when it is chawed as Aloes and Manna, is not made ſmaller, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth the parts, cleauing together lyke <hi>Chiamaſtiche,</hi> but theſe are proper to that treatiſe, which ſheweth the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of medicines, which we could not but ſomewhat touch in this booke, for either we muſt neuer haue made mention of any particular exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, but haue bene ſatiſfied with vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall methodes, or if particular ſhould be put to vs the preparation of them was to be touched.</p>
               <p>But as we before haue ſaide, it is conuenient that wée be here pleaſed with one or two examples, put out of thoſe remedies which are inuented by Methode, and this thing I will ſtill remember. But lette vs turne likewiſe, to that againe, that in ſpeaking we haue little finiſhed,

There are many other medicines which haue an empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique facultie, yea, without griefe, but there is none that doth ſo incarnate.</p>
               <p>It is chiefely to be regarded in this caſe, that the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine falling of, that fleſh be engendred about the veſſel.

And there hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to many a flux of bloud, that could hardly be ſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, after that the aſker hath fallen of, wherefore who ſo will in theſe alſo miniſter all things by a method, he will long before conſider all theſe wayes, wherewith bloud is ſtenched, and chooſe that which is with leaſt daunger, not omitting the other wayes as often as neceſſitie requireth, for I haue found great neceſſitie of vſing medicines, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18258:95"/> an aſker, and alſo of hot yrons, whereas the fluxe of bloud ſprang of eroſion, of anie humour which did putrifie, as alſo in that affect where all that doth putrifie is taken of it, it is moſt ſafe to burne, as it were the rootes of it, or elſe to vſe medicines which make an aſkar, and by this occaſion we come to that neceſſitie both in the priuie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and alſo in the fundament, becauſe thoſe partes both for their naturall heate, and that they be the conduites of Excrementes, they putrifie of a ſmall cauſe. That ſcope which thou tendeſt vnto, for thoſe medicines making an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar, muſt not onelie be hot, but ſuch as hath with it alſo ioyned &amp; aſtringent facultie, ſuch is perceiued to be <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis,</hi> and <hi>Miſi,</hi> and Vitriall, whether thou vſeſt them crude, or rawe, or aduſt.

The bloud that floweth out of the veſſell, either is ſtenched for that it floweth no more to the parte, becauſe the diuiſion is ſtopped, or elſe through both, which I ſuppoſe to bée moſt ſure. But the bloud is let to flowe to the parte; either through binding, or when as it is diuerted to the contrarie partes, or is deriued to the parte adiacent, or by refrigeration, either of the whole bodie, or elſe of the affected partes, ſo that colde potions haue often ſtaied the fluxe of bloud, as alſo colde things in fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons outwardlie applied.

And although they are not dangerous by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſton it ſelfe, yet when as they long continue, they are not voide of perill.

               <p>It is euident that the affect named <hi>Dyapedeſis,</hi> is to be cured with aſtringent and refrigeratiue medicines, and if it chaunce at anie time through too thinne bloud, you muſt vſe groſe dyet.

And that doe ſome of thoſe affirme, who be profeſſours of onelie Experience, and ſome vſing this reaſon. For they ſaie, the one coate of the arterie is hard and cartilagious, but ſuch bodies cannot vnite together, when as the abilitie of vniting is onelie of ſoft bodies, as may appeare in extreame thinges, neuer ſtone ioyning to ſtone, or ſhell with ſhell, and alſo in our ſelues, for neither Cartilage with Cartilage, or bone with bone doth growe together, for broken bones truelie doe not cleaue together by vnition, but are ioyning together by <hi>Callus,</hi> the Gréekes call it <hi>Poron,</hi> as it were with Glew. Therefore we will alſo beginne firſt with our Experience, and put before your eyes thoſe things that wée haue ſéene in women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, both the arteries to bée conglutinated, and alſo to be compaſſed about with fleſh, and that in the forehead, anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, ioynt of the arme, and wriſt, ſuch a like thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in time paſt to a ruſticall young man, when in the ſpring time he would be let bloud, which our Countrie men haue in great vſe, but when the Phiſition who ſhould open the veine, had bound the mannes arme, it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the arterie to riſe bounching vp, and the Phyſition opened it in ſtead of the veine, trulie the Orifice was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmall, the bloud ſtraight waies iſſued out yeolowe, thinne, and hot, and that as it were leaping, pulſe like, and the Phiſition truelie, like as hée was a verie young man, ſo was he little exerciſed in the workes of the Arte, though he had opened the veine, but when I with another of the auncienter Phyſitions that were preſent, did beholde that which had chaunced, preparing a medicine of the kinde of Emplaiſters that ſtaunch bloud, I did both diligentlie ioyne the diuiſion, and alſo by and by laide the medicine
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18258:98"/> on, and vpon it bound a moſt ſoft Spunge.

               <p>Among all other, I neuer ſawe none cut in the Cubite, but <hi>Aneuryſma</hi> followed, to ſome greater, to other leſſer.

And although an Arterie bée harder to cure than a veine, yet there is no contrarie vſe of medicines in both, yea, they bée all one in kinde, varying onelie by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of exceſſe and defect. For the Arterie doeth require ſo much more drying medicines than the veine, howe much by his proper nature he is of dryer temperament than the veine.</p>
               <p>But if thou wilt engender fleſh about both, they both require like medicines, for fleſh is in like ſorte engendered
<pb facs="tcp:18258:99"/> in compaſſing the veines and arteries, as is ſhewed in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of hollow Vlcers. And the veines and arteries that are in the matrix, bladder, or inteſtines, ſéeing that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire medicines like in kinde, when as they are exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they alſo require Inſtrumentes, whereby Iniections may bée made, <hi>Metrenchitas,</hi> that is, Cliſters from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, and a pipe bound right through, and a Cliſter. And to theſe Vlcers which are in the inteſtines, you may make iniections of the liquide medicine, bloud warme, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a bladder, vnto the end of which is annexed a right pipe. The ſubſtaunce of the medicines ſhall be varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of the Inſtrument. Neither is it méete to poure into theſe Inſtruments groſe medicines, but they require moiſture, and therefore for the more part moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hot. Therefore drie medicines are more apt than thoſe that are named Liquide, becauſe they are eaſilie mixed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the iuyce of Plantaine, or anie other of like kinde. Such be Saffron, and Pompholix, and Aloes, and thoſe that in Gréeke are called <hi>Cephalica.</hi> In the firſt time of engendering fleſh, which is preſentlie after the ſuppreſſion of the bloud <hi>Terra Lemnia,</hi> is an healthfull remedie.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT the Vlcers that are in the lungs, are more hard to be cured, and truelie in ſome the cure is not onelie difficill, but alſo ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to be done at all, as well to them that followe Reaſon, as alſo to them that profeſſe Experience by Reaſon, ſo that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the inward partes, it is thought to be continuallie mouing, wheras thoſe vlcers which are to be cured, require reſt and quietneſſe, as Experience ſheweth, becauſe they neuer ſawe anie cured that was ſo affected. And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture we maye doubt of Experience. For it is méete that we beginne héere for knowledge ſake, for wée haue ſéene one, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hée cried loude, another falling from an high
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18258:99"/> place, and another ſtriken in wreſtling, not onely preſently moſt grieuouſly to cough, ſo that alſo with the cough ſome to vomite one or two pynts of bloud, and ſome other more, of thoſe that were in this caſe. Some of them were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without dolour, and ſome complained on their breſt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the bloud in thoſe that complained, was not caſt out altogether, neither was it much and leſſe red, or hot, as that which came a farre of, but to thoſe that were voyde of griefe the bloud came guſhing out, and much in quantitie, being red and hot, manifeſtly ſhewing that it came not farre of. Surely, the tranſſumption of the bloud, from the breſt into <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> bringeth a great doubt, but of thoſe Phiſitions, who ſuppoſe that it cannot be ſent out by the cote, which inueſteth the lunges. And peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they would haue affirmed, that the bloud could neuer be voyded by the mouth, out of the breſt.</p>
               <p>Many of thoſe that were affected, felt preſent dolour, &amp; other hauing an inflammation, which after dyd ſupperate, ſhewed a manifeſt token that the affect was in the breſt.</p>
               <p>But now being confounded by theſe ſignes, they graunt that it commeth from the breſt. But while they ſéeke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, yea, by the cote of the lungs, they are conſtrained to bring out many, and that abſurde things, although as I ſuppoſe, they ſée moſt euidently in them, whome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréekes call <hi>Empios,</hi> the mattier it ſelfe, which they confeſſe to be in the middeſt ſpace, betwixt the lungs &amp; the breſt, to be ſpyt out from the lungs. We verely haue vſed to them <hi>Melicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> which was iniected into the breſt, to be ſpyt out from the lungs, in thoſe where was ſo great an Apoſtume, that part of the bones was putrified.</p>
               <p>Surely at <hi>Rome,</hi> we haue ſéene ſuch affects amongſt the Romans, to haue after remained in the breſt, ſo that of force we were faine to cut out the affected bone, and in many alſo the Pannickle, which within is ioyning to the ribbes. This being found putrified with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corrupt ribbes, we are accuſtomed in this cure to vſe <hi>Melicratum,</hi> to be put in by the vlcer, the pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inclining himſelfe on the affected part, to cough, and ſometime haſtely to blow his noſe, and in the
<pb facs="tcp:18258:100"/> meane time with an inſtrument that draweth out matter, the Gréekes call it <hi>Pyulcon,</hi> to bring out the <hi>Melicratum,</hi> that remained, this being done when as we truſted that we had voyded out both all the mattier, and alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sanies, by &amp; by wée iniected Medicines, ſo that in theſe affects, if thou leaueſt in the cured ſpace betwene the breaſt &amp; the lungs, any moiſture, thou ſhalt preſently cauſe the ſame to be caſt out with coughing. Truely wée doe maruaile of thoſe that doubt of the waye by the lungs, why they doe not rather doubt how groſſe bloud iſſueth out of the Callus of a frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured bone, for the bloud which iſſueth, is more groſſer tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is natural, and the ſubſtance of the ſkinne is a great deale thicker than the pannickle inueſting the bones. Therefore as we ſaide, when as any veſſell of the lungs is broken, either with falling, or with loude crying, and that without griefe there guſheth out much bloud hot and freſh, by coughing, you may vnderſtand that the wound is in the lungs, the cure muſt be taken in hande after the manner that we often haue done, and that many tymes with good ſucceſſe. Therefore we muſt commaund the pacient that he vſe not great reſpiration, and furthermore, that he alwayes vſe ſilence.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the inwarde veine of the Cubite muſt be opened, from which twice or thriſe afterwarde thou ſhalt take bloud, becauſe we may diuert it, then rub and binde all the the ioyntes, as we are wont. Theſe thinges being done, thou ſhalt firſt giue him to drink <hi>Oxicratum,</hi> delayed, and bloud warme, that if in the inward part, there be any congeled bloud being reſolued, it may be ſpit out, and thus doe twice or thrice in thrée houres, then giue him ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which both hath an Emplaſtique vertue, and is alſo aſtringent, and that firſt with delayed <hi>Oxicratum,</hi> or with the decoction of Myrtiles, or ſuch lyke aſtringent.</p>
               <p>Againe, at night giue him this medicine in like ſorte, ſuffering him not to eate any thing if the affect be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but elſe giue him of ſome ſupping, that ſhal be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and it ſhall chiefely profit, if the pacient be ſtrong, if that the next day a little bloud be taken out of the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18258:100"/> veine, and ſo to continue in diet and medicines, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, vnto the fourth daie, the breaſt in the meane time, if it be in Summer, being moiſtned with oyle of Roſes, in Winter, with <hi>Vnguento Nardino.</hi> And if thou wilt vſe an Emplaſtique medicine, thou haſt an excellent one of our making, which boldly thou maiſt alſo vſe to other wounds, it is made of Aſpaltum and Vineger, and other which are accuſtomablie mixed to thoſe medicines, which Phiſitions call <hi>Enaema Barbara.</hi> But if thou cure a woman with childe, or him that hath ſoft fleſh, the medicine that is called <hi>Diachalciteos,,</hi> is verie conuenient, whoſe vertues I haue declared in the firſt booke of Compoſition of medicines. And by this waie we haue cured many, vnto whome wée came preſentlie as they felte paine, for this is the greateſt thing, vnto which it behooueth thée to be greatlie attendant, whether preſentlie vpon the rupture of the veſſell, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneſt the curation, that thou doſt adglutinate the gréene wounde before there that bée inflamation, for if inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flowe, there is after ſmall hope of adglutination, but yet you may prolong the time. And the cauſe that ſuch vlcers can hardlie or not at all bée cured, is, that when the inflamation is cured, the mattier and <hi>Sanies</hi> of the vlcer are to be taken awaie, but in the matrix or bladder, they are voide of their owne accorde, when as the Patient lyeth groueling, and alſo we maye cleanſe them. But in the lungs neither of theſe are to be done. Therefore in all vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which are in it, all the purging that is made, is onelie by coughing.</p>
               <p>But if we commaund all quietneſſe and ſmall reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſpeake little, that the wound maye adgluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, what hope can there be of curation to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cough, but the cure is to be diſpaired of, for that through reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this member doeth continuallie moue, and thoſe that haue bene before our time do iudge it ſo, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vacuation of the mattier and <hi>Sanies.</hi> But if anie is preſentlie cured by this waie, the wound wil cloſe, and if inflamation do come, the cure is both hard and vncertaine, when as the mattier &amp; <hi>Sanies,</hi> cannot be expelled out of the places of the lungs,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:101"/> and that the cough doe ſtretch the parts affected. But thoſe that are brought out of the breaſt, haue a triple aduantage more than that which is euacuated out of the lungs. For the ſubſtance of <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> which is altogether drie, &amp; voide of fleſh, is not found in anie parte of a liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe that falleth in the like, are wont to be broken, if anie other veine or arterie be ruptured, the <hi>Aſpera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi> remaining ſound, the tranſlation of the bloud is by opening of the mouths, called in Gréeke <hi>Sunanaſtomaſis,</hi> ſo that in ſuch, the bloud which commeth out, is neither hot, nor red, nor yet much, and theſe affectes at the firſt ſéeme ſmall, not inducing feare through the great euacuation, but trulie they are héereby the more perilous, for the bloud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iealed about the ruptured parts, which cannot eaſilie paſſe through <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> letteth adglutination.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Herefore let vs againe repeat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Methodes, &amp; ſhew how much the generall curation of all vlcers, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly to be changed, according to the ſeuerall parts of man. And hereof we ſhall chiefly learne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was purpoſed in the whole worke, that is, to erre ſo little as may be, in curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as an appendix of their audacity, which call themſelues Methodicians, who if you will credit mée, I accuſtome not to ſpeake of flatterie or hatred, they being of all other Phiſitions moſt voyde of Methode doe condemne.

But the Emperickes truely, ſay that all thinges which haue ſhewed to haue bene found out by indication, be knowen to them by experience.</p>
               <p>Now ſéeing that there is not a third inſtrument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, beſides indication, and experience, theſe vſing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both, yet think themſelues worthie to be called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicians: therefore let them follow vs, and now at the leaſt, let them ſhew one way of curing all vlcers, in euery member. Let vs heare theſe good fellowes, by what way they will cure an vlcer, and what indications are taken of it, whether there is any other than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vlcer which is plaine, to be ciccatrized, that which is hollow, to be filled with fleſh, the gréene wound, to be adglutinated. But how ſhal I finde that which will ciccatrize, and that which will incarnate, and that which will adglutinate, trauell not ſay they, they are alredie inuented, but I can not tell whether rightly, or whether all be found out, it may happen thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are found out, to be of the worſt, but the better are not yet inuented, or elſe thoſe which are inuented be nought.</p>
               <p>And hereof it commeth that certaine vlcers cannot be cured, either in longer time with dolour &amp; nedeleſſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:102"/> neither dare any of them go to a new experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be perſuaded that he hath rightly condemned the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way of curing, as in theſe vlcers of the lungs, which can not be knowen at all without the knowledge of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathomie, and of the actions alſo which they vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre. But for this preſent let vs graunt that theſe <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> know the vlcer that is in the lungs. But whether ſhall we in like caſe as we haue graunted this to them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo graunt that they know whether it is filthie, or pure, or equall, or hollow, or full of Sanies or mattier, or elſe that they doe know it by diuine inſpiration, or that they haue ſéene theſe by dreames, or ſhall we graunt that, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of theſe, euery medicine is to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I verely iudge that the mattier in filthie vlcers is firſt to be purged, and thoſe that be hollow and pure to be filled with fleſh, and then againe the mattier and Sanies which is about the Vlcer, to be purged, and then ciccatriſe to be made.</p>
               <p>But truely I know now how theſe haue cured ſuch vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for <hi>Theſſalus</hi> hath nothing at all writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe, leaſt he ſhould bewray either his ignoraunce, or elſe inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for either they ſpeake of theſe, that which is either not with reaſon, or that which is falſe, or if any will ſpeake truth, it behoueth that he take indication of thoſe vlcers, of the ſubſtance of the part, the ſituation and forme. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte that they know to diſcerne the vlcer in the lungs, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie or pure, with inflammacion or elſe without: graunt we alſo vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although of a leſſe thing, yet of this they calling not the inuention to them ſelues, that ſuch an vlcer is to be mundified with the gréene medicine of <hi>Macherion,</hi> or <hi>Iſis,</hi> all is one. Let them aunſwere mée, if the vlcer be in the lungs, what will they doe? will they giue any of this gréene medicine to be taken inwardly, it is altogether ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, but let them ſay which way they know that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to be carried into the lungs, but if they might know that, neuertheleſſe the ignorant knoweth not whether it reſerueth ſtill that vertue which it had, being outwardly applyed to Vlcers, but admit that both they know this,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18258:102"/> and that it kéepeth his force ſtill that it had, being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applyed to vlcers, and that it doth purge the filth, yet can they not vnderſtande whether it prouoketh cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when as notwithſtanding, except the filth ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by coughing, there is no néede of a mundificatiue medicine. But we will alſo graunt them this thing, but yet they cannot deny, but that they vſe a contrary cure, in the Vlcer of the thighes, and Vlcer of the lungs, for they cleanſe the one with water, and mundifie the other by coughing.</p>
               <p>Againe, imagine the vlcer of the lungs to be compaſſed with groſſe mattier, will they alſo then giue the gréene me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, or rather commaund the pacient to licke Honey, but let them tell whereby they ſound this, truely I will not aunſwere that becauſe it hath a certaine facultie of extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating or cutting, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they doe flye moſt willingly from ſearching out ſuch faculties, but it is not méete that they ſhould vſe Honey, as the Empericks doe, who by many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations in the like caſe, haue founde Honey to profit, firſt becauſe they deſpiſe experience, then for that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perickes doe confeſſe that they know not what affect is in the lungs, in ſuch like concourſe, notwithſtanding to haue by experience found out that which may profit, but it is not ynough for <hi>Theſſalus</hi> to cure that which he doth not at all know, but he procedeth of the indication of affects. But if we truely ſhall grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as before, that he knoweth all things as well as our ſelues, yet can he not eſcape that, but that the way of curation is changed in diuers partes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, for it is not one way of curing to make iniection, with <hi>Mellicratum,</hi> into the matrice in a filthie vlcer, or to giue Honey to be eaten, or to waſhe the vlcer with a ſpounge, but theſe yet be but of ſmall accompt, the other of great, let vs ymagine an olde Vlcer to be in many partes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inflammacions, as in the eye, eare, noſe, mouth, thigh, belly, matrice, fundament, and priuie members, let it bée alſo, that the ſame Vlcer is either playne or wanteth a little hereof.</p>

I once found one of theſe moſt ſapient <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians</hi> curing an olde vlcer in this ſort, when as the eare of the man dyd putrifie, &amp; wormes grew in it, for that it was to ſoone ciccatriſed with <hi>Diacadmia,</hi> notwithſtanding ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him many dayes to vſe the lyke medicine, was becauſe the eare did dayly more grieuouſly ſtincke, and was filled with matter, we ſée him preſume a more incredible thing than before, for he ſuppoſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the depth of the eare, there was inflammation, he vſed <hi>Tetrapharmacon,</hi> which truely muſt more increaſe, the putrifaction of the part, becauſe it cannot exicate the vlcer, but maturate the inflammation, &amp; when as he had vſed this medicine one daye, to cure the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and thou maiſt know it to be moſt repugnant, by and by there was a great dele more matter, and an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtench, wherefore the friends of the pacient would not ſuffer the <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> to touch any more the eare, &amp; he true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of impudencie and fooliſhneſſe, would not onely put in ſome of the <hi>Tetrapharmacon,</hi> but outwardly alſo apply a relaxing emplaiſter, but when as the kinſfolke of the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent drew him away, ſuſpecting the pacient to be in great perill, I deſired them that the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> might haue the curation one day longer. For the next day after, the matter was more aboundant, and the ſtench moſt greuous, which day I dyd aſſay, whether I might change the minde of the <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> leaſt he ſhould kill thoſe that were ſicke: ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken ſect, ſo far voide of all methode, might yet ſaue ſome hereafter, though they be few, then I began with the fellow in this ſort, whether or no ſayd I, ſéemeth it vnto thée, that there is an inflammation in the inward part of the eare, &amp; therefore thou vſeſt relaxatiue medicines, and he did ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vouch it ſo to be, and alſo that it could not be otherwiſe: whether or no ſayd I, haſt thou ſéene at any time an Vlcer ioyned with infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation to be cured, with moſt ſharpe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger and <hi>Glauces?</hi> Neuer in my lyfe ſayth hée, for if any
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18258:103"/> do vſe the Trochiſce of <hi>Andro</hi> diſſolued in vineger, he may peraduenture cauſe conuulſion: <hi>Ergo</hi> (ſayd I) if one vſeth another medicine more ſtronger than the <hi>Andronian Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſce,</hi> in moſt ſharpe vineger, and that to the care, which is a parte ſo néere the braine, and his coates, whether thou being iudge, ſhall he make conuulſion, and eſpeciallie if there bée inflammation, theſe thinges ſéemed to bée true both to him and to the companie preſent, wherefore in the reſpect of the ſtate of the partes, which require ſuch as maye chiefelie exiccate, but nowe béeing made ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the curation, I would vſe ſuch a medicine.</p>
               <p>Now for that thou haſt abuſed them manie daies, it is not méete at once, or at one brunt, to tourne them to the contrarie, for it is lawfull for thée and <hi>Theſſalus</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne cuſtome, as well as the nature of the partes, but thou maiſt not ſo doe, but the firſt daie I will vſe Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with Glaucium, the ſecond daie the Trochiſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> and the third daie I will goe to a more vehement medicine than the Trochiſce of <hi>Andro</hi> is, and vſing this thrée or foure dayes, if then I ſhall perceiue the Vlcer to require a more vehement medicine, I wil nothing doubt to vſe it, &amp; outwardlie I will applie it to the part of the head, where the eare is infected, now ſurelie as thou doeſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing Cataplaſme, but ſome one medicine that can vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentlie exiccate, ſuch a medicine as is made with <hi>Salicen,</hi> or elſe applie <hi>Andronean Trochiſce</hi> with Vineger, or ſome other that doeth more drie, for ſeeing the parte which wée cure is moſt drie, it behooueth moſt ſtronglie to drie it, for that the affect it ſelfe may be cured, it ſheweth that the contrarie muſt bée applied to the parte it ſelfe that it is moſt like vnto, and ſo as I haue ſayde, I wrought and cured the man without anie more vehement medicine. But to certaine other which require more ſtronger medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, whereas the Vlcer had infeſted the eare one or two yeares, wée applyed a medicine more vehement than theſe rehearſed, and that was <hi>Scorta Ferri,</hi> beaten and ſearced through a moſt fine Searce, and after brought as
<pb facs="tcp:18258:104"/> it were vnto fine flower, and ofter boiled in moſt ſtrong Vineger vnto the thickneſſe of Honie, it is certaine that there muſt bée a great deale of Vineger in the mixture, but as I haue often ſayde, thou muſt ſéeke thée plentie of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in other of our Commentaries.</p>
               <p>Now wée haue finiſhed that belongeth to a methode, for ſéeing the place of hearing is moſt drie, it doth require me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that may moſt vehementlie exiccate, which wée may not applie to anie other part, but to the vlcerate part, peraduenture the Collirium made of <hi>Dialibanoton,</hi> vnto the noſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo it behoueth to vſe that which is more drying than in the eies, but yet not ſo much as to the eares. Wherefore all the Trochiſce rehearſed be profitable, and alſo the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine aſcribed to <hi>Muſa,</hi> and other of the like kinde. All Vlcers of the mouth if the be moiſt, requirey vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iccatiues, as <hi>Diaphrigis,</hi> both alone, and alſo mixed with Honie, or Wine, or Oximell, and further, that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iris Anthera,</hi> and theſe either drie, either mixed with Honie. Alſo <hi>Mulſa</hi> is a medicine for theſe profitable. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the iuyce of <hi>Rhois</hi> and Omphacine, and other which doe ſtronglie drie. What doe I tarrie in rehearſing theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? But the ſimpler Vlcers of the mouth maye aptlie bée cured by medicines which do moderatly dry, as theſe, which for that they are in continuall vſe, are called <hi>Stomatica,</hi> ſuch medicines bée <hi>Diamoron,</hi> and of the fruite of Rubus, and of the iuyce of gréene huſkes of Walnuttes, and yet more than theſe, that which is made of Muſt and Cipreſſe, and thoſe Vlcers of the mouth that are verie moiſt, néere vnto the bones, ſo that the bones bée in daunger to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, theſe béecauſe of the nature of the bones which is drie, requireth moſt vehement deſiccatiues, therefore I doe alwayes make fine the Trochiſce aforeſayde, and put to theſe medicines drie.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, all that ſide of the hill is of good big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtretching in length to the Sea <hi>Tirrhenum,</hi> this hill doeth a little bend towarde the Weſt, neither goeth it wholie towarde the South, therefore this Hill doth kéepe the ſtraight frée from the winde which bloweth from the Eaſt, <hi>Eurus ſubſolanus</hi> and <hi>Boreas,</hi> there is ioyned to this in the loweſt of the ſtraight, another bigge Hill, which the auncient Romanes in their Hyſtories, and thoſe alſo that bée now diligent, call <hi>Veſuuium,</hi> now <hi>Veſuuium</hi> is a a famous and new name, and knowen to all men, for the fire ſent out of the earth in it, which thing doth not as I thinke, helpe to the dryneſſe of the aire, and that beſide the fire, there is not in all the ſtraight either ſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, marriſh, or floud of anie account, this <hi>Veſuuius</hi> Hill is toward all thoſe windes, which blowe from the North toward the Eaſtuall ſetting of the Sunne, and much aſhes commeth from it, euen to the Sea, béeing the aſhes of that

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is none of all theſe, which I haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, or before declared, that I haue inuented or vſed, according to <hi>Hyppocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> waie, which is not examined and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by iudgement, but alſo tried by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in which we ſuffered the perilles of the error. They ſhall haue profit by the vſe of them that haue regard to the workes of the arte, for ſome of their talkes are true, and ſome ſophiſticall, but what ſpeake I of Sophiſts? when as there are ſome Phiſitions of eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which haue ſet out whole volumes of reiection of bloud, and haue written many ſmall rules right well, making no mention of anie principall remedie, vnderſtanding by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, thoſe thinges which rightlie admoueth the ſick to get his health againe, in thoſe that are not altogether deſperate, and are cured by letting bloud and purgation, and thoſe things which ſtrengthen the head, and wée ſhall héereafter ſpeake more diligentlie of letting bloud, when as we ſhall ſhew the curation of ill iuyce. Therefore wée muſt not begin, as many Phiſitions iudge, with ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, neither muſt we thinke as they doe ſaie, that theſe ſmall remedies are firſt to be proued, and then if they doe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18258:109"/> profit nothing we ſhall apply greater, this opinion is true in ſuch diſeaſes as are without daunger, but it is furtheſt from reaſon, to begin with ſmall remedies, where the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt die, if he once haue <hi>Pthoe.</hi> For like as all other things are rightly ſet out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſo alſo is that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme</hi> rightly ſayd, that vnto extreme diſeaſes, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally extreme remedies profit, by what opinion therefore was <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> ſo madde, ſo ſlow &amp; dull in the beginning of ſuch affects, but after when occaſion was paſt, to be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, for being perſwaded by a moſt fond reaſon, he neuer doth let bloud, when as bloud is required, nor purgeth any man, or yet doth exicate his head. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which things if the patient being in daunger of that <hi>Pthoe,</hi> kéepe and abſtaine himſelfe, although all other things be rightly done, I think he doth nothing more, for he refuſeth to let bloud, and doth onely vſe to diuert it with binding of the ioynts, whereby as he himſelfe ſaith, there may remaine plentie of bloud againſt the time of inflammation, and that we be not for want of it, to nouriſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patient, but peraduenture ſome wil ſay: ſir how <hi>Eraſiſtratus?</hi> If after the ruptured veine, the inflammation occupieth the lungs, there is no cauſe why thou ſhalt hope to cure the man, for conſiderations which I haue ſet out before. Wherefore he ſhall now no more néede this trauell, being betrayed, or deceiued, by thée at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for he doth like to a gouernour of a ſhippe, when through his negligence, the ſhip is caſt away, he geueth to ſome one of the paſſengers a borde in his hande, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth him ſo to ſaue his lyfe, but <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> perchaunce did ſuppoſe, that an inflammation was in the number of thoſe, that neceſſarily follow a wound. Notwithſtanding if he ſo thought, he was in great ignorance, when any man may behold great wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds without inflammation, to be glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated, of ſixe hundreth, ſuch as dayly doe fight a combat, ſo that the ſecond, or fourth daye, they be in ſafetie, and we haue cured many of thoſe, who had ſome veſſells of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lungs ruptured, by falling, crying, or ſtripe, before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſprang in the ruptured veſſel, and if he doe affirme any of theſe, to haue inflammation of the lungs, he doth
<pb facs="tcp:18258:110"/> repugne with his owne decrées, affirming both that, and the principall couering, which is next to the heart, to haue inflammation, and alſo to be frée from a feauer, alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation being broken the man to voyde out nothing. Therefore againe, let him heare of vs, that the Vlcer can not be adglutinated, if the lungs be inflamed, and that if inflammation commeth, of force he ſhall haue a Feuer, and that when the inflammation is broken, the patient ſhall with coughing voyde mattier.</p>
               <p>Therefore if one hath neuer a Feuer, or cough, nor voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no Sanies, from the vlcer, and inflammation, by what reaſon is ther in the lungs of this man any inflammation. Therefore both this principall remedie is vniuſtly of him condemned, &amp; alſo he letteth ſlip purging, without making mention of it, it is no medicine of affect, ſet out of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of the forenamed kinde of griefes, but if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head ſend downe flux, it ſhall be kept in the ſame ſtate, or if that cough followeth, through intemperateneſſe of the members ſeruing reſpiration, that ſhall alſo ſo remaine, ſo that <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtratus,</hi> ſhall be like vnto the Image maker, who, when the partes were perfectly made and finiſhed, he left the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage without eyes, for to what beautie I pray you are the other parts, when as thou wanteſt thine eies. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Gods name, ſéeing ſo excellent men haue erred, that famous man <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> which doth not at all know the art, iudgeth himſelfe worthie to be called a Methoditian, and we ſée now almoſt all his diſciples to let bloud, not onely to many vnto whome bloud letting is not profitable, but alſo to thoſe kinde of remedies which ought to be iudged hurtfull, eſpecially, if they ſhould ſtand in their owne ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and alſo to thoſe that are ſtrong, which reiect and put foorth bloud, either by vomiting, or coughing, but how ſhall theſe hang together, that both they byd to let bloud, where there is reiecting of bloud, and that in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries they write the remedie, herein to agrée with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let them call them ſelues no more Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicians, but Emperickes. If ſetting apart reaſon, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18258:110"/> they thinck to be right, to vſe onely experience, to the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of remedies, are they not in theſe moſt clearely found neither by reaſon, neither by any Methode, to doe any thing. Much more when as they ſay the parts are vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to the finding out of the cure.</p>
               <p>But if any doth call to minde thoſe thinges which wée haue taught, of the Eares, Noſe, Eyes, Mouth, Breaſt, and Lungs, alſo of that we haue ſaid, of the matrix, bladder, and ſtomacke, he ſhall finde them to erre, all the way, ſuch one was he, that to the inflammation in the ſecrete parts, he applyed the Macedonian medicine, and with this alſo a relaxing Cataplaſme, euen that notable one, that is made of Bread, water, and Oyle, alſo a nother like to him who vſed the ſame medicines to the place exulcerate.</p>
               <p>But we will ſpeake of ſuch, when we ſhall diſpute of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, but thoſe Vlcers, which are in the yarde, or fundament, without inflammation, require no relaxing Cataplaſme, but a Ciccatrizing medicine, not onely of that nature, that may ciccatize the Vlcers in the fleſh, but that they may ſo much the more exciccate, as theſe partes are dryer than the fleſh, yea, and that which thou maiſt more maruell, the Vlcers which are in the ende of the yarde called <hi>Pene,</hi> are more to be dryed, and thoſe which are in the necke of the Bladder, called <hi>Cole,</hi> and thoſe which are without the ende of it, called the Acorne or Glans.</p>
               <p>But the Vlcers in the fore-ſkinne are to be leſſe dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet leſſe than theſe, whatſoeuer are in the ſkinne which couereth. Therefore when as one of theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodleſſe Phiſitions (I meane theſe <hi>Theſſalians</hi>) could not cure a moyſt Vlcer, in the Acorne, or Glance, with Epulotike medicines, that is with ſuch as doe make a ciccatrize.</p>
               <p>He choſe mée of counſel, &amp; when he heard of mée the part required a more drying medicin, becauſe it was of drier na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he did forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleue me, but being of force co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to vſe ſome of our medicines, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vlcer was cured in. 3. daies,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:111"/> and it did well appere that the Phiſition reioyced, not ſo much in the health of the patient, as he was ſorowfull he was trained vp in ill kinde of doctrine, for the medicines vſed of vs which is made of Paper combuſt, cureth theſe kinde of vlcers, like as Dill and Gourds, being combuſted and ſtrowed vpon the grieued part, and vſed as before, and other like which in like ſort doe vehemently drye, &amp; if there be any ſuch vlcer, voyde of moyſture, to ſuch onely Aloes is a conuenient medicine, it muſt be ſprinkled in, but dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made into moſt fine pouder, and it doth alſo cure well the vlcers of the fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dament, with dry <hi>Cadmia,</hi> waſhed in wine and dryed, hath the ſame vertue, and <hi>Litharge</hi> is of like facultie, next in vertue is <hi>Molibdena,</hi> and <hi>Pomphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> doth leſſe induce dolor than the reſt, and is not to any of them inferior.</p>
               <p>If the vlcers be moiſt, both the rinde of the Pine trée alone, and alſo <hi>Lapis Hematites,</hi> be very good, and if ther be any déepeneſſe, when as thou wilt rayſe fleſh, put to any of the foreſaide medicines, ſo much Manna, as ſhall ſuffiſe to incarnate withall, neither doth this Methodleſſe ſect, know any of theſe, ſo much as by dreaming, ſéeing they ſuppoſe that euery wound, in what part of the bodie ſo euer it be, require one curation, neither how it behoueth to cure certaine wounds, as thoſe which doe happen to <hi>Abdomen,</hi> of which in the booke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhall intreat, with all thoſe which yet doe remaine.</p>

When this happeneth in the fleſhie partes, it is called an vlcer, and hath indication of curing, which is common to all affects againſt nature, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, the affect it ſelfe, which as it is an affect, is to be taken awaie by his contrarie, as diuiſion by vnition, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this affect conſiſteth in diuiſion of vnitie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the bone it is called a fracture, in Gréeke <hi>Catagma,</hi> in the neruous pannicles <hi>Spaſma,</hi> in the muſcles, a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe differences are before ſet out, yet to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe when as it hapneth in a vein or arterie, it hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name, but borroweth ſometime the name of an vlcer, ſometime of a wound, and ſometime of a ruption, but wée haue often ſaide, that he ought not to be ſo carefull for the names, whoſe ſcope is, to finde out the knowledge of things.

And furthermore, of thoſe which be of quicke or dull feeling. Moreouer, of thoſe which are burthened with fulneſſe, or haue but little iuyce, being not ignorant that he ſhalbe oppreſſed with inflamation, which is either <hi>Plethori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> or haue euil iuyce, the Gréekes call them <hi>Cacochymci,</hi> or is of quicke féeling, or vexed with ſome of theſe, or elſe with all, &amp; that he that is contrarie ſhall féele no hurt, &amp; we beholding theſe things, wil not put to adglutinatiue. Such are many of their medicines which are called <hi>Enema,</hi> &amp; bée preſentlie applied to gréene woundes, but a ſoft medicine and gentle, &amp; that ſhall aſſwage dolour, but when as there is a great diuiſion, there we muſt bend our ſtudie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the lips
<pb facs="tcp:18258:113"/> of the wound, may be vnited and cloſed with deſiccatiues, and where the diuiſion is made with a néedle or ſteele, there regard muſt chieflie be had, that the part be not vexed with inflamation, and héereof it is manifeſt, that the indication of a gréene wound ſet out of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> doth hetherto teach vs no more than euerie priuate perſon knoweth, for it is no great matter to knowe what behooueth to bée done, béeing a thing naturallie grafted in all men, but to know how thou ſhalt performe it, that onelie doth belong to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, for if anie ſhould build a ſhip, we all know (yea, being no Shipwrights) in what place the things which gouerne the ſhip are to be placed, in what place the ſtarne muſt bée, and where the beke ſhoulde ſtand, and all the reſt, yet all theſe profit vs nothing, being ignorant how the ſhip is to be builed. In like ſorte, he that goeth about to build an houſe, is not ignoraunt, that the foundations of the walles are firſt to be layde, neither that the walles ſet on theſe, or that are to bée erected, ought to bée directlie right, neither that the roofe muſt be ſet on theſe walles, neither that the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, doores, and other partes of the houſe muſt bée accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie placed, but what doeth theſe thinges helpe to the building of a Houſe, inſomuch as hée béeing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the arte of building, knoweth not how to builde it. Therefore it ſéemeth ſufficient vnto <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> of all other men moſt ſapient, touching an artificious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to vnderſtand what ought to be done, but wée haue ſhewed in theſe Bookes before written, that this is but a certaine beginning of thoſe workes which are looked for of the Artiſts, being no proper part of the arte, but ſuch as is common to all men, for the firſt indications in euerie arte, are naturallie grafted in all men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if this bée ſufficient to make Artiſts, what letteth but we may build ſhips, and make matter, and all men maye readilie make ſhooes, and garments, and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and alſo to be <hi>Architectiſtes,</hi> Muſitions, and Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, but it is not ſo, neyther is hée a Phyſition, that knoweth howe that there muſt bée made natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnion in the wounded parte, but hée whiche
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18258:113"/> vnderſtandeth with what thinges that maye be done, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that this is not inough, if he knew not how to vſe them, but he onlie is a Phiſition, who knoweth all the way ſo farre, vntill he may attaine his deſired ſcope. Therefore it happeneth to theſe methodleſſe Diſciples of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> that preſuming great thinges aboue their might, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not vnto thoſe, which otherwiſe they might. For when one latelie was wounded with a Stile in the hand, in ſuch ſorte, that all the ſkinne béeing diuided, ſome of the nerues vnder was pricked, a ſapient <hi>Theſſalian</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning applyed an emplaiſter, which hée often vſed with good ſucceſſe in great wounds, he thought (I ſuppoſe) that euerie wound had one curation, but an inflammation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, hée applied a Cataplaſme, which is made of wheat floure, and ſo rotting the member, killed him within ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen daies. Neither can it bée numbred how manie haue periſhed by conuulſion, happening into their <hi>Peoman</hi> handes. Whereby if God will, this Theſſalians decrée may bée kept, and euerie gréene Vlcer is like to bée healed, and that the partes affected giuing no indication. But the true methode is not as this methodleſſe methode of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalus,</hi> but euen now, and that after ſo great Phiſitions, there may bée found, not onelie better medicines than haue bene, but alſo a vniuerſall waie of curing, for no man vſing preſentlie at the beginning thoſe medicines which we haue inuented, ſell into conuulſion, for I truelie noted where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a nerue was, and how there followe of neceſſitie greater dolour than in other partes, becauſe it hath ſharpneſſe of féeling, and that alſo of force there followeth inflammation, except one did aſſwage the dolour, and let the generation of inflammation.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſéemeth reaſonable to mée, that the wound of the ſkin bée kept open, and without glutination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the mattier may flowe out of the wound, and then to vnburthen the bodie of all ſuperfluities, and chiefelie to be carefull that the wounded parte bée frée from dolour, ſo I haue excogitated not a fewe medicines, which béeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the wound, doeth meruailouſlie ſerue both vſes,
<pb facs="tcp:18258:114"/> both to mittigate dolour, and to make way to the comming out of the mattier, and it ſhal bée more ſure if the ſkinne be wider cut, and that the bodie bée emptied by bloud letting, if the Patient bée ſtrong. And if the bodie bée full of ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, preſentlie purge him, and warme water, (although it doth much mittigate other inflammations,) it is moſt hurtfull to wounded nerues, ſéeing their ſubſtance is made of a moiſter mattier refrigerated and coniealed, and all ſuch conſtitution is reſolued, and doeth putrifie by thoſe thinges which doe both make hot and moiſt, therefore I kept thoſe which were thus wounded from warme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, iudging it méeter to foment the place with warme oyle, becauſe that I haue alſo ſhewed, that oyle béeing applyed colde, doth ſtoppe the ſmall pores, but if it be hot, it dooth digeſt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I fled alſo crude oyle, called in Gréeke <hi>Omotriues,</hi> and that which had an aſtringent faculty, &amp; thoſe which was moſt thinne, as <hi>Sabinum,</hi> which if it be two or thrée yéeres olde, is the more profitable, for becauſe that which is olde, doth more digeſt by euaporation than that which is new, and how much elder it is, ſo much it is able to digeſt, but yet it doth leſſe ceaſe dolour in medicines. All my whole ſcope was to haue their facultie attenuated, and moderatlie heating, and which might exiccate without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of dolour, ſéeing that this onelie could drawe the mattier from the bottome, the part being thereby neyther contracted nor yet bitten. Trulie I firſt vſed Turpentine and Roſen both alone, and mixing with it alſo a little Euphorbium, I vſed it alone in Children and Women, and generallie in ſofte bodies, but with Euphorbium in hard bodies: in like ſorte alſo <hi>Propolis,</hi> both alone, and ſoftning it alſo with Euphorbium, and if it were more hard with ſome thin oyle. I vſe alſo in hard bodies <hi>Sagapenum,</hi> mixing it with oyle and Turpentine, and after the like ſort alſo I vſe <hi>Apoponax,</hi> euen as I doe <hi>Sagapenum.</hi> Alſo <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrima, Epreniaca,</hi> is not vnprofitable, if one make an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſter of it, in ſuch ſorte as wée haue made with Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, but wée haue not approued this by experience, as we
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18258:114"/> haue done all the other, for it behooueth that the inuention of remedies which commeth from a true methode, doth goe before, and then experience for the more certaintie to follow this, and we hope that by the ſame Method. Alſo Sulphure which hath not touched fire, nor is ſtonie, but of thin parts, ſhall profite him that is wounded in the neruie partes, mixing ſo much of it with thinne oyle, as that it come to the thickneſſe of <hi>Sordium,</hi> or as you would ſaie, rotten mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier which commeth out of a ſore, and in ſtrong and harde bodies thou ſhalt profit if it bée as thicke as Honie, for that is alſo allowed by Experience, we haue alſo excogitated, to applie to this wound waſhed Lime mixed with thicke Oyle, which if it were waſhed with the Sea water, it wold more profite, it is beſt to waſh it in the dogge daies, and if thou doeſt waſh it thrée or foure times, the medicine is the better, but in what manner ſuch medicines are to bée pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, thou ſhalt vnderſtand in our Commentaries which we haue ſet out of the compoſition of Medicines. And it is héere ſufficient for mée to ſhewe that I haue inuented both theſe, and many other medicines againſt the woundes of Nerues, ſéeing that I neuer ſawe them vſed vnder anie Maiſter, neither yet ſée them ſette out in anie of the olde Bookes of curing, or in the Bookes of the faculties of the auncient Phiſitions, but I tooke indication of the nature of thinges, which I thinke to be the office of the Phiſitions which vſeth a Method.</p>
               <p>But this wonderfull <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> when he neuer yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented one medicine, doeth affirme, that euen nowe the matter of them to be knowen, but the matter of many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which wée haue excogitated, is not onelie vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> and the Phiſitions before his time, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe which hath béene ſince, vntill this daie. For I in times paſt béeing called vnto one, which was made rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of theſe methodelſſe Theſſalian Phiſitions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held that hée woulde applie that Cataplaſme which is made of Wheate meale, hauing no other medicine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I aſked of a certaine Potter, neighbour to the patient
<pb facs="tcp:18258:115"/> ſome lée, and by boiling it in Barlie meale, and not in oyle and water, as he did the Wheate meale, I applyed it. After which, in like ſorte, the meale of <hi>Eruum</hi> boiled, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it to the nerue, the inflammation béeing inflamed and rotten, by the good cure of theſe Theſſalians, I deliuered the Patient from the ſame putrefaction. But of theſe woundes which putrifie with inflamation, wee will large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſpute in a conuenient place of this worke, and that is now ſayde is ſufficient for wounded nerues. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie among thoſe medicines which wée haue found out, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie do vſe that emplaiſter which is made of Euphorbium, Waxe, and molten Roſen, and ſo to make a compoſition thereof, and ſome ſuppoſe it to be my inuention, but I made it ſo at the firſt, and peraduenture ſome mixed with it <hi>Flos Salis,</hi> or ſuch like thinges, which might alter the choler, and not diminiſh the vertue of the medicine, but through ignorance one may adde ſuch lyke things, that ſhall change the vertue of it. But wée made it of Waxe, Roſen, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, Pitch, and Euphorbium, putting in one parte of Waxe, of Turpentine, and Pitch, of each, halfe a parte, ſo that the quantitie of theſe two, maye bée more than the Waxe, or you may mixe the one of theſe with the Waxe, and alſo in the ſcarceneſſe of Turpentine, you may aptlie vſe <hi>Humidum pineam,</hi> that is to ſaie, moiſt Perroſen, and alſo to put into theſe <hi>Abietenam,</hi> but <hi>Scrobilina,</hi> is onelie méete for harde bodies, wherefore it is not to bée mixt for ſofte bodies, therefore if thou doeſt mixe <hi>Humidam reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> then put that in thy Euphorbion beaten and ſearced, to the other béeing molten, let the waight of it be the twelfth part of the waxe, or a little more, when as thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineſt to make the medicine ſtronger, but if it be drie as <hi>Fucta</hi> is, then the Euphorbion deſireth a little oyle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beating it with oile, and making it to thickneſſe of Honie or Sordium (which is thicke mattier) the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the melting béeing colde, I doe mixe them, ſtirring them together.</p>
               <p>Alſo I often mixe in making the medicine ſo much water as maye quite euapour awaie and bée conſumed,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18258:115"/> in melting the mixed ſimples. But all this kinde doe moſt appertaine to the treatiſe of compounding medicines. Now it ſuffiſeth as before we haue done, to put for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples ſake, a fewe particularly, ſhewing what the kinde of medicine ought to be, for thou ſhalt finde in our woorke, <hi>De ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus medicamentis,</hi> a copious matter of medicines, and you muſt prepare them, as I ſhewed in the work of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Wherefore it is ſufficient to haue declared thus much, and to paſſe forth to other things.</p>
               <p>The curation of the wounded Nerue, doth require me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which may prouoke a moiſt heate, and doe ſtrongly drye, and that alſo by the ſubſtance of their making, hath power to attract, and is of thinne partes: truely the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue methode, doth not onely profit to the inuention of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and diet, but alſo to the vſe of theſe which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, for like as before we haue declared, ſo now alſo we doe affirme, that he which goeth about to finde apt medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for an Vlcer, without a methode, cannot vſe the leaſt of them rightly. For he is able to cure by a certaine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, who vnderſtandeth how much the application of the medicine, hath either dryed the affect, or made hot, or mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, or increaſed, for he onely doth know how to adde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe which he vſed at the firſt, or to take away from them. For when one had applyed at the firſt to a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Nerue <hi>Dia Euphorbion,</hi> or that he had luckely before made profe of it, he ſhewed mée how the third daye that the wounded part had dolour and inflammation, maruailing that the medicine did nothing profit, I then aſked the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, whether the firſt day when the medicine was apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he felt not a ſoft heate, as it were of the Sunne, and he denyed to haue felt any ſuch thing. Then againe, I aſked the Phiſition, how long he had that medicine by him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and when he had cured with it, he aunſwered, that he had it a yere, and had cured with it two children, and a young man, &amp; when I demaunded of the body of the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man: he affirmed that it was white, and ſoft, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I heard theſe things, perceiuing that there lacked <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> for this young mans temperature.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:116"/>
               <p>I demaund the Emplaiſter, and alſo <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of both, ſo much as I thought ſufficient to mixe them together, I bad him ſoften the medicine with his handes, &amp; ſo beat the Euphorbium diligently, and theſe being done, I bad him mixe them together, and I making ſomewhat hot, Oyle of Sauine, which was olde, and foment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the wounded part. And opening lightly the puncture which was cloſe, I did put the medicine into the hole, and willed him to abſtain from meate. I bad alſo the Phiſition, that when he did take it away at night, that he ſhould vſe the oyle in like ſort as he had ſéene mée. And theſe being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, the day following the affected part, was found void of dolour and inflammation. And all they that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, vnderſtoode that to be moſt true, (that we often ſaye) the medicine can doe no great thing, except there be one, that can rightly vſe it. For the right vſe is that, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth by the ſame Methode, which we haue often ſet out in the bookes going before.</p>
               <p>All the vſe of medicines being referred vnto it, colde, moyſt, &amp; drye, as vnto certaine rules, which Methode theſe Methodleſſe followers of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> are not able rightly to follow, neither yet <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> or any other Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which hath not ſought out the Elementes of bodies, or hath put out other thinges than thoſe which wée haue here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vut if the Nerue be not pricked but cut, you muſt conſider in what ſort it is wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Whether it be cut ouerthwart, or in length: and alſo how much of it is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Lette vs firſt put for an example that there is ſo great diuiſion of the ſkinne, that the bare Nerue doth appeare, and that this Nerue is cut in length, and not ouerthwart, thou ſhalt not apply to this Nerue any of the rehearſed medicines, which are made of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> or ſharpe medicines of like kinde.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:18258:116"/>
               <p>For the bare nerue cannot now abide their force, as when the ſkinne was betwixt it and the medicine. Therfore vſe thou in this caſe waſhed Lime diſſolued in much oyle, and alſo Diapompholix is verie profitable diſſolued in a great quantitie of oyle of Roſes, and it ſhall be the better, if both the Oyle of Roſes, and alſo the oyle to be without Salt, for all the ſcope of curing the Nerue béeing bare, is to exiccate without biting, and truelie there be few medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which can ſo work. Therfore in this caſe in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer let him be waſhed in healthfull freſh water, let alſo the Pompholix bée, (as is afore ſayde) waſhed, becauſe it hath many other ſimples, which are not waſhed. For all medicies which conſiſt of mettalles, ought to haue all theſe waſhed, if they ſhall exiccate without mordica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>That is alſo an healthfull medicine, which is made of Honie Plaiſter wiſe, béeing made of the beſt Honie, and this be reſolued in oyle of Roſes, which in all reſpectes is the beſt, and voide of Salt, yea, and the Waxe alſo which is put into ſuch medicines muſt be waſhed in like ſort. If thou putteſt in anie Turpentine, it behooueth that thou waſh it, and ſo much the ſooner if thou put anie other Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine in, for the ſharpe and biting Sanies is waſhed and purged awaie by all medicines which thou doeſt waſh. But if hée that is wounded bée ſtrong in bodie, and voide of ſuperfluous excrements, in him it is requiſite to vſe more ſtrong medicines. As I once did, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a young man ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in Philoſophie was wounded in the breaſt, hauing a good ſtrong bodie, and burnt with the Sun in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeaſon. The Trochifce of Polida diſſolued in Sope, and afterward made warme, beeing put ouer hot water, I applyed it as a Liniment. For that firſt of all we muſt haue regarde that nothing bée colde which toucheth the wound. For becauſe the affected part is moſt ſenſible, and alſo the chiefe of the principall partes are continuall, and of temperament cold: by which all occaſions that is grieued is with cold, &amp; ſendeth alſo his greiefe to the braine. But if it be of theſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come into the muſcles, it cauſeth alſo conuulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:18258:117"/> For we haue ſhewed in our Anathomie, that the muſcles are the inſtruments of voluntarie motion, and the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulſion ſhall be looked for in the tendons, by the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but when as I had applied the foreſaid medicine to the wound of this young man, and had couered much of the partes aboue the wound, with the ſame I did continuallie foment with hot oyle the partes about the arme pits, neck, and head, and opening a veine, the firſt daie I tooke ſome bloud from him, and the fourth daie this young man alſo was well, inſomuch as the vlcer looked wrinkled, ſmall, and ſhrunke together, notwithſtanding I thought good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with the ſame medicines vntill the ſeauenth daie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which daie he was perfectlie well. Trulie you may fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this wound with oyle, and chieflie as we haue ſaide, when it is cured, for oyle is of contrarie nature to the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſce, and maketh the Vlcer filthie, neither is there ſmall difference to applie oyle to a bare nerue, &amp; where the ſkin couereth it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the mattier is to be wiped awaie from the wound with a probe, hauing ſoft lint rolled about it. You may if you will, wet your Lint in Sapa, leaſt that thou touch the Vlcer with drith: with Sapa, that is, <hi>Sirium,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo with vs and in <hi>Aſia, Hepſama,</hi> therefore dipping thy lint in this, and after preſſing it out, thou ſhalt mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie the Vlcer, and let this Sapa bée warme the firſt daies chiefly, but if all things doe proſperouſly ſuccéed, thou maiſt wet it alſo without daunger with ſwéete Wine, for all ſwéete wine is void of all biting qualitie, ſuch is the wine called <hi>Thereum</hi> and <hi>Scybelites.</hi> And next theſe is, <hi>Cargi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> what Wines ſo euer are ſwéete and yeolowiſh, ſuch is <hi>Falcrun</hi> being vnprofitable, for all theſe are ſharpe and vnmeaſurable hot. And the vlcer comming now to cicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize, white and thin Wine, and that which will not abide the mixture with water, neither ſwéete ſmelling, is better than ſwéete wine, and thou ſhalt eſchue the vſe of water to a wounded nerue, and alſo a relaxing Cataplaſme: next vnto the vſe of theſe Trochiſces, is the vſe of <hi>Diachalciteos,</hi> which we openlie vſe, this muſt be molten in Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18258:117"/> oyle of Roſes, but in winter with the Oyle of Sauine, we haue deſcribed this medicine in the firſt booke of compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding medicines, the <hi>Paſtilles,</hi> or <hi>Trochiſces,</hi> or call them how you lyſt of <hi>Polyda,</hi> are knowne to all men, which if you haue not, you may take the <hi>Trochiſce</hi> of <hi>Andro,</hi> or <hi>Paſio,</hi> or elſe our owne, which is ſtronger than the reſt.</p>
               <p>And we haue declared that to ſtrong bodies, ſtrong me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are conuenient, as to tender bodies, gentle medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: this right Methode haue I inuented, and experience doth confirme it, but <hi>Theſſalaus</hi> with his Sophiſtes, ſitting in his high throne, ſhall be had in reputation among brute people, as <hi>Cercidas</hi> ſaith. While he confirmeth by his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that there is one curation of gréene wounds, neither this to require any Indication to the nature of the parts, yet one of ſo great ſame in his learning hath excogitated, a marueilous cure of wounded Nerues, for preſently he cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them a ſunder, geuing the wounded man no warning thereof, although in this he goeth from his ſecte, for it had bene better to cut a ſunder the wounded muſcles and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; veines, or any other thing, but not the Nerue, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that thing which they flie, they are found to doe, that they may take a contrary indication, for the difference of the parts: but let vs leaue them, and intreate of a Nerue wounded ouerthwart, in which there is greater feare of conuulſion, inflammation comming of Feuers, which are not cut, but thoſe which pertaine to the cure of the Vlcer, are like alſo to theſe. Yet it behoueth more largely to take away bloud, and vſe more thinne diet, and to kéepe him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together quiet in a ſoft bed, and to foment largely with hot Oyle, the arme pits, necke, tendons, ligaments and head, &amp; if the wounded Nerue be in theſe, that are in the legges, like as we vſed Oyle to the arme pittes, when the wound was in the hand, ſo in theſe the flankes are largely to be fomented with Oyle, and ſo to aſcend, by the whole ſpine, to the necke, and head. And the contuſed Nerues, whereas the ſkinne alſo is contuſed and wounded, require the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which is vſed in drying the wounds of the Nerues. But yet ſuch medicines as may further draw &amp; conſtringe
<pb facs="tcp:18258:118"/> or binde the parts diuided by contuſion: but thoſe which are contuſed without the like affect of the ſkinne, ought to be fomented often with hot Oyle, which haue power to euaporate, and to haue like regard to the whole bodie, as I ſaw this to happen, and dyd ſpedely cure it, fomenting it with oyle, but haue often ſéene the Nerues, to be contuſed with the ſkinne, and the wreſtlers for the cuſtome of the accident, being taught by vſe, haue a Cataplaſme made of Oximell and Beane floure, which truely is an healthfull medicine, but if dolour alſo commeth with contuſion, it doth behoue to put in molten pytch, and boyle them well together, and ſo to apply the medicine hot, and if thou wilt make it more drying, put in the floure of <hi>Eruum,</hi> and if thou wilt haue it yet more drying, put in <hi>Iris ilirica,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to be had to the whole bodie, it is common to theſe, as if the Nerue be all cut, there reſteth after no perill of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulſion, but yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part ſhalbe weake, it hath the ſame cure, that the other Vlcers haue, although the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> know but one: therefore we haue abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly intreated of Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, but how we ſhall cure the inflammation that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to them, we ſhall ſet out when as we ſhall intreate of Phlegmone.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18258:120"/> put in hot water, and afterward expreſſeed out, and in the meane time to prepare auſter Wine, made hotte, for that doeth more heate than water, and ſtrengtheneth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine, but if the inflation of the Inteſtine ceaſeth not by this meanes, thou muſt cut ſo much of <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> as is inough to put in the Inteſtine conuenient Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, for this Inciſion, are <hi>Springotoma,</hi> (that is to ſay, ſuch as ſerue the Inciſion of Fiſtulas. Kniues which are double edged, or haue ſharpe pointes, are to be refuſed: the conuenient placing of the Patient is, when the wound is made in the lower parte, if hée lie vpwarde, and when it is in the vpper partes, if hée lie backwarde, in both theſe one thing is to bée regarded, that the Inteſtine which is out, bée not preſſed of thoſe that are within, and that ſhall this waie bée done, as if the wounde bee in the right ſide, to bende the bodie to the contrarie parte, if in the lefte, then to the right ſide, in ſuch ſorte, that the wounded parte alwaie bée higher than the reſt, and this is profitable alſo both in great and meane wounds, for that is a common aduice in all.</p>
               <p>But the repoſition of the Inteſtines into their place, when as they are fallen out in a great wound, doeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie require a perfect miniſter, for he ought to compaſſe outwardlie all the whole wounde with his handes, and to preſſe inwardlie, and to gather together, and to leaue the place bare, to him that ſtitcheth it, and alſo to compaſſe moderatlie that which is ſtitched, vntill all the wound bée ſtiched.</p>
               <p>Now wée will next teach the apteſt waie of ſtitching ſuch woundes in <hi>Abdomen,</hi> becauſe it behooueth that <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen</hi> doe cloſe and ioyne with <hi>Pentoneum:</hi> you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne from the ſkinne, and thruſt the néedle from without inward, and when as it hath gone through both the ſkinne, and the muſcle called <hi>Rectum,</hi> leauing that <hi>Peritoneum</hi> which is vnder it, thou ſhalt from within thruſt thy néedle outward by the reſt of <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and ſo by the reſt of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> putting the néedle from within outwardlie, and when it hath gone all through this againe, this <hi>Abdomen</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:18258:120"/> is to be thruſt through from without inwardlie, and when thou haſt left that <hi>Peritoneum</hi> which is vnder, and come to the contrarie parte, thou ſhalt alſo thruſt this through from within outwardlie, and with all the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> that is, next after this beginne heere againe, and ſtitching it with the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> of the contrarie ſide, and againe putting it through the ſkinne, next the néedle is to be put in that part inwardlie, and ſtitching that <hi>Abdomen,</hi> with the contrarie <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and againe going through the ſkin, and thus againe and againe till it be done, and vntill the whole wound be ſtitched, the ſpace betwixt the ſtitches ought to be moſt ſmal which pertaine to the kéeping faſt of thoſe parts, which be vnder, but this ſmalneſſe is not ſure inoughe to the ſtrength of the ſkinne, and kéepe it from breaking, which is the ſpaces betwixt the ſtitches, wherefore eſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exceſſe of both, let vs chooſe a meane betwixt both, and this alſo is, as it were a common thing in all wounds, that is, the ſubſtance of the thréed it ſelfe, wherewith wée ſtitch, for that which is too harde, muſt of force teare the ſkinne, that which is to ſofte is preſentlie broken, in lyke ſort if thou doeſt thruſt thy néedle through the edges of the wound, the reſt of the ſkinne béeing moſt little, is conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to teare, when it is violentlie brought together, but if thou goeſt farre from theſe, thou leaueſt much of the ſkin vnglutinated, and although theſe things be common to all woundes, yet they are eſpeciallie to bée eſchued in the ſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and the ſtitching of <hi>Abdomen</hi> ought to bée done this waie rehearſed, for if anie doe ſuppoſe that he may make <hi>Peritoneum</hi> to cloſe with <hi>Abdomen,</hi> but it will ſcarcelie growe with him, becauſe it is neruous, or elſe as manie vſe, which ioyne them together that be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of affinitie, as <hi>Peritoneum</hi> to <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and that ſhal be in this ſort, it behoueth to begin of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> next vs, &amp; from without inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to thruſt a néedle through it onelie, &amp; letting paſſe both ſides of <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> of the contrarie part, from without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie drawe the néedle through both lips, after put that

               </p>
               <p>Now let vs ſpeake of medicines, truelie thoſe ought to bée of the ſame mattier that they are, which are named <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nema,</hi> which we haue in the bookes going before ſhewed, to vnite the wound of other partes: ligature outwardlie, is chiefelie héere neceſſarie: the laſt parte of the curation in theſe, differeth much from the other, for the ſpace betwixt the flankes and arme pittes, ought to bée wholie couered with ſofte Wooll dipt in Oyle moderatlie hotte, and yet more ſure, if thou put in by a Cliſter into the Inteſtines ſome ſuch like thing, and if anie of the Inteſtines be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that which is outwardlie to bée done, muſt bée per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in manner aforeſayde, but that which is iniected muſt bée auſter, and red Wine bloud warme, and ſo much the rather, if it bée pearced through to the inward partes. And the thicke Inteſtines are eaſilie to bée cured, as on the contrariwiſe thoſe that bee thinne, bée harde to be healed, yet <hi>Ieiunium</hi> is altogether incurable, both for the bigneſſe &amp; multitude of the veſſells, and alſo for that his coate is verie thin and neruous.</p>
               <p>Further, becauſe this Inteſtine receiueth all the pure coulour, and is next the liuer of all the reſt. And thou mayſt boldlie cure the woundes of the ſtomacke, which are in the lower fleſhie partes, for it may happen to take good ſucceſſe, not onelie for that theſe partes are thicke, but alſo for that the medicines which doe cure, doe eaſilie reſt in this place.</p>

Therefore whereas anie hath firſt of all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed himſelfe in theſe our Commentaries, let him applie himſelfe to the reading of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> Bookes, and let him both reade his booke of Vlcers, and alſo that which he wrote of mortall Woundes, then truelie hée ſhall receiue great helpe of theſe our Bookes, and alſo ſhall vnderſtand that none of the Mothoditian ſect, which challengeth to himſelfe this glorious Title, but in verie déede bée furtheſt from a methode, can rightlie cure an vlcer or wound, and alſo that none of the Emperikes, which thinke to exerciſe the arte, little knowing the Elements or temperamentes of the ſimiler partes of man, for theſe knowe not the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall cure of the ſimiler partes of man, becauſe they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie take their Indications of the organike members, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few wordes hetherto vttered, againſt theſe Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditians, of thoſe woundes which happen in the Stomacke, we will conuert our ſtile to other thinges. <hi>Peritoneum</hi> béeing wounded, <hi>Omentum</hi> doeth preſentlie fall out, which whether it bée ſimiler or no, or of which it is made, or what action or vſe it hath, they doe not vnderſtande: therefore it is woorth the trauaile, to heare what they will doe, whereas that parte which is fallen out of his place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwart and blacke, whether will they cut it off, or put it againe within <hi>Peritoneum?</hi> Surelie either they ſhall vnderſtand all together by Experience what is to be done, or elſe take Indication of the nature of the parte, but both theſe flyeth from them, both that knowledge which is miniſtred by Experience while they extoll a methode, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reuerend name of their ſect, and that which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>Therefore it ſéemeth good time now, to ſhew the true method of curing a Fracture, with the nature of the things preſcribed, taking our beginning from hence, becauſe there is ſolution of Continuitie of the partes of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bone, their vnition is at the fore firſt ſcope, whereto hée muſt bend him that will cure them: but if this ſéeme impoſſible to bée done, becauſe of the dryneſſe of the affected partes, there remayneth another ſcope: that is, that they may bée adglutinated by the helpe of another thing, which thing is a certaine humour, comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the endes of the broken bones, as it were a Glewe, and to ioyneth them faſt together, which if that be found not to bée done, thou maiſt call the affect vncurable: and that ſuch an harde bone as is in young men, ſtriplings, and men, and much more in olde perſons, cannot growe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I thinke it euident to all men, for truelie that bone onelie will be vnited, which is verie ſoft, ſuch are the bones in Infants, but ſome doeth greatlie hope, that the partes of a broken bone ſeparated, may againe bée adglutinated and knit by ſome other ſubſtaunce or glew comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt.</p>
               <p>It is ſhewed that euerie part of the bodie doeth attract to himſelfe his owne and lyke nouriſhment, which if it bee true, then ſurelie the conuenient nouriſhment of the bones is groſer and more earthlie than anie other nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment in the whole creature: ſo that it is not repugnant to reaſon, neyther a thing impoſſible, that of this ſame proper Element, which aboundeth and groweth in the edges of the Fracture, maye by his comming betwixt the bones cloſe them together, for to Vſe ſheweth, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18258:123"/> Experience conſenteth to that hope which reaſon doeth geue: therefore it is hence foorth to be conſidered by what meanes this thing that groweth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fractures, how much, and what maner a one, may comfort. For it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that we require not what maner a one, but ſuch one as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in both, a mediocritie: wherefore, this ſimentrie, both in qualitie and quantitie, being found out. Furthermore it is requiſite to ſéeke out by reaſon, whether we may attaine to them both or not: but the time when this ſhalbe done, is no leſſe neceſſarie to be ſought out, whether preſently as the fracture is made, ſhall wée make vnition, as in wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, or that this be not a time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, but a more apter muſt be found, ſuerely, thou being inſtructed, by the nature of the thing, maiſt find out this as wel as all other. Therfore what is the nature of the thing? Forſoth the broken bone comprehended vnder ſome of the rehearſed differences of fractures: goe to now, let vs ſée whether any thing may be taken of euery difference which ſerueth to the curation, beginning with that fracture which is made ouerthwart, named <hi>Cauledon,</hi> the parts of the broken bone, doe here ſo lie, one beſides another, that they lay not directly euen, wherefore it is manifeſt, that firſt they be brought directly euen, to that ende they may the better grow together, then to doe ſome of the things that follow: truely that ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low if one vſing the example of the whole part, doth draw the bones that are a ſunder, to the contrary part, of which is taken moſt ſure indication, of the tranſpoſition of them. For truely, it may happen that the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpoſition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhall be made forward, backward into this and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part. For it is méete, that whatſoeuer are backward, be brought forward, and yet neuertheleſſe, the other part of the broken bone, is to be moderately thruſt to the contrary: Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, that which is forward, is to be deduced backward, &amp; the other part by little and little, to be brought forward.</p>
               <p>In like ſort the conſideration of thoſe which are wreſſed to the right ſide, is if they be brought to the left ſide, and againe thoſe which are in the left ſide, if they be changed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſide, alwayes drawing the other part, moderatly
<pb facs="tcp:18258:124"/> to the contrary: but there is no ſmal dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, leaſt in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the partes, by contrary motion, ſame of the ſhiuers, which ſticke out, be broken, neither are both the endes euen as thoſe which are ſawed aſunder, and if they be broken, the endes of the broken bone, cannot exactly be ioyned, and that for two cauſes, for if the péeces fall betwixt the two parts, they let the parts to touch, which are formed right, or if any fragment falleth outwardly, neither ſo ſhal there be perfect coniunction of the bones, which thou haſt framed in ſuch wyſe, as they ſhalbe like their firſt vnion, for that onely happeneth when the ſhiuers of the bones, be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in their owne places. And if they being broken doe periſh, there muſt of force be a voide ſpace, betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bones vnited together, in which Sanies being collected, and in ſpace putrifying, doth corrupt alſo the whole member. And for theſe cauſes, the bones which are a ſunder, ought to be drawen right out, and this cannot well be done, except firſt they be ſtretched backward, the Gréekes call it <hi>Antithaſis,</hi> therefore it behoueth to make this <hi>Antithaſis,</hi> of bones, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thy hands, if the member be little, or with bands put about the member, or elſe with ſuch inſtruments, as <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> hath taught, and when as they haue enough drawen back, and that they be out of doubt, leaſt they in bringing together ſhould touch them ſelues, then put them right and loſen the bandes, and let the muſcles of the parts to be in one, and in the meane while helpe thou with thy hands, and if any thing doth leape vp, amend and forme it, and next this, whereto thou muſt bend, is that the member doth remaine vnmoued, leaſt any of the parts which thou haſt placed, be moued, for ſo of force they muſt againe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.</p>
               <p>And if thou commit it to the patient, that he looke to the quiet reſt of the member, peraduenture waking, he wil regard it. But ſléeping truely he wil moue it, but that the bones formed may kéepe their ſituation, not onely the man ſleping, but ſitting and riſing: when the bed is made, it behoueth to binde the fracture, with a ſafe Ligature, which may exactly kéepe the parts of the broken bone together.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:18258:124"/>
               <p>But for that looſe ligature ſuffereth the bones to mooue, that which is too ſtraight by compreſſing, doth bring do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, let vs giue diligent héede, that eſchuing both diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, we maye inioye both commodities, which wée ſhall doe, if wée eſchue extremitie, ſo that we ſhall not make the ligature ſo ſtraight that it compreſſeth, neyther yet ſo eaſie that it bée looſe, and if euerie member were of equall thickneſſe, then the broadeſt roller were moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, becauſe it ſhoulde embrace all the broken bone of euerie parte equallie and continentlie. But ſeeing it is not ſo, although to the breaſt thou vſeſt a moſt broade rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, thou canſt not ſo doe in the ioyntes and necke, but in ſuch, a narrowe roller is better, for that it will not wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, and that it toucheth the ſkinne of the whole mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, about which it is put, but if it holdeth the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with a fewe fouldes, it is not without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Therefore how much ſureneſſe wanteth through the narrowneſſe, ſo much muſt bée added by often rolling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and by deducing it towarde the ſounde partes, but ſéeing all rollings which doe conſtipate and coarct the fleſh without dolour, hath that propertie to preſſe the humours out of the partes where they are firſt put on, and doth put and fixe them in thoſe in which they end, I thinke it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to beginne the ligature vpon the fracture it ſelfe, and ſo to proceede vnto the reſt of the member, for hée that doeth otherwiſe, putteth the bloud to the affected parte, but if he beginne vppon the hurt parte, and endeth in that which is whole, ſuch ligature ſhall not onelie be voide of hurt in theſe, which we haue ſaide, but be alſo profitable, for that it ſuffereth no inflammation to ariſe about the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of which principallie regard muſt be had, and it is to be feared leaſt great inflamations folow, both of the ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the contrarie part, which we vſe in forming right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the member, and alſo that the cauſes which make the Fracture, do firſt hurt the fleſh, inueſting the bones by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipation and contuſion, neither meruaile I if ſome ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:18258:125"/> thing, like an inflamation happeneth to the portion of the bones, when as ſuch as are not rightly cured, are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſéene to be more moiſt than nature requireth, where wée ſée a wound with a broken bone, neither commeth <hi>Caries</hi> of the bone, in Gréeke named <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> anie other waie, which is corruption of the whole ſubſtaunce of the bone. Therefore thou ſhalt not bée negligent, but expell thou all the ſuperfluous moiſture from the partes which are about the fracture. Therefore thou maiſt begin vpon the affected part, and bring the roller about twice or thrice, and procéed then toward that which is ſound, for verilie he that thus doth roll, ſhall defend the fluxe of bloud to come from the whole partes, to thoſe which are affected, and doeth alſo put out from hence that which is héere alreadie collected. Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then that there are two partes, which maye both receiue anie thing of the affected part, and alſo ſend vnto it. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth they which lie vppon it are moſt readie vnto both, as well for the multitude, as alſo greatneſſe. But the extreme parts for the contrarie cauſe, can receiue or ſend but little, neither can miniſter much, either to the affected partes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiue of them againe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when as <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> made the firſt two ligatures, with the firſt he did not expell that was in the affected part, to thoſe that are aboue, and alſo doth expell that which floweth from them with the roller. For with the firſt rollings about, which he doth make vpon the frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by deducing it to the lower parte, he thruſt ſome mattier thether, and letteth that none ſhall flowe from thence.</p>
               <p>The reſt of all the inuoluings, with which he will haue the roller to goe from the lower partes vpward, that they may in the ſame place with the firſt, both repell to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er partes, and alſo preſerue fluxe from theſe, wherefore the two firſt rollers doe defend and ſtrengthen the Fracture, neither ſuffer they inflamation to ariſe. Notwithſtanding theſe alone are not ſufficient to both theſe vſes, ſo that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> did deuiſe for their defence a remedie, that ſplents bée applied with the laſt rollers, which might alſo ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18258:125"/> theſe: and he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to vſe ſome one medicine, which is againſt inflammation, leaſt there ſhould follow inflammation, ſuch a medicine is <hi>Ceratune humidum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore all theſe are inuented (as we haue ſayd) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and alſo the figure of repoſition, &amp; this alſo hath a two fold indication, the firſt dependeth of the common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely, the other which is taken of the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members to be cured: the firſt indicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſuch figure is to be chiefely choſen, which is moſt frée from dolor and griefe, ſo that there follow no inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the part, and that the patient be beſt able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine longeſt in this without mouing. The ſecond indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which is taken of nature, willeth that the arteries, veines, nerues and muſcles, be moſt rightly placed. And theſe indications doe agrée. For the righteſt figure of euery part, is frée from dolor, and that which of the reſt is moſt frée from dolor, is moſt natural to the part, for to the arme, the figure which is cornerwiſe in Gréeke <hi>Eggonios,</hi> for the leg that which is ſomewhat leſſe ſtretched out. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, not onely the naturall habit is profitable to euery member, not onely in auoyding of dolor, but alſo the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome ſéemeth much to profit: and this is the waye of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the figure, in which the member is to be kept, which alſo differeth not in ſéeking out the figure, vſed in extending the parts a ſunder, called in Gréeke <hi>Diataſis,</hi> and alſo when the partes of the broken bone, are brought into their naturall place: for it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient that both thou doſt extend the member in the moſt right forme, and that which is furdeſt from dolor, and alſo that thou formeſt it into his naturall habit, and much more that thou roll it in the ſame figure, and alſo placing it to reſt: for the mouing thereof doth not onely prouoke dolor, but alſo doth wreſt the bones by mouing the member being in one figure, and to change it to another, for except I haue forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe precepts which we haue written in our bookes <hi>Da muſculorum motibus,</hi> it is neceſſarie, that whereas the figure is altered, there ſome of the muſcles to be ſtrained, and to be made round as they were contracted, and other to be loſe and relaxed.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18258:126"/>
               <p>Therefore of force where they are extended, there they are compreſſed of the roller, and by the compreſſion, doe ſuffer paine and dolor. And where there is no extenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there the ligature is loſe and ſlacke, and ſo the fracture wanteth his ſtaye: and for becauſe of all theſe, we muſt ſtudie that we doe both extend, and forme the member, and alſo roll and repoſe the member to reſt vnder one, and the ſelf ſame figure, and ther is no precept left vnſet out, which belongeth to the firſt worke in Fractures.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commaundeth) loſe the roller the third daye, leaſt there ſhould ariſe dolor and itching in the member, vnaccuſtomed to be ſo couered, and alſo that the perſpiration of that which is now fixed in the member be not letted, by whoſe occaſion there doth not onely fall thereto, an vnhappy itch, but alſo the ſkinne to be vlcerate and coroded, with the ſharpneſſe of Sanies: wherefore we muſt poure in ſo much of temperate water, as ſhalbe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to take away this Sanies. And if thou wilt againe doe as it is aforeſaid, thou oughteſt to doe it the vii. daye.</p>
               <p>All things now are apparent, ſo that nothing hindreth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frée from inflammation, and ſomwhat gentler, than for naturall conſtitution. Then it ſhalbe lawfull to apply ſplents, and roll it more wider aſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, for it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, to vſe ſplents before the inflamation was paſt.</p>
               <p>But now when as it is ceaſed, &amp; that néede is to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the fracture, ſurely you ſhall vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. And you may alſo let the rollers remaine longer time, the partes hauing no néede to expell Sanies: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore <hi>Callus</hi> in Gréeke or <hi>Poron,</hi> ſhal ſo luckely follow when it behoueth to the generation of it, (as it is afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) ſome of the proper noriſhment of the bone to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together and grow. Therefore this is now to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed away from the lips of the fracture, or elſe to be eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pored, for elſe truely it ſhall make ſolution of continuitie, neither ſhalt thou let it ſlip, ſo long time, that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not how the fracture goeth forward: for we haue often ſéene, that when the bones were vehemently dryed, <hi>Callus</hi> hardly dyd grow.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:18258:126"/>
               <p>Wherefore it is méete to poure vpon theſe a little warme water, the third or fourth daye, leauing when as the fleſh riſeth in a red tumor, and wée muſt leaue herein, before it beginneth to aſſwage. Contrarywiſe, when as we will digeſt any thing, we ſhall not leaue of, before all the tumor be vaniſhed which ſprong of the perfuſion: and whereas the aboundant moiſture is, and let that <hi>Callus</hi> doth not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grow, there we ſhall go about with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient ligature to exicate, as is before ſaide, and with perfuſion of water, which muſt be altogether little, or much: for it ſhalbe but little, when it ceaſeth, and before any thing floweth to it: &amp; the humors which be about, be digeſted, and doth diſſolue thoſe which are déepe fixed. For it is expedient ſo to loſe &amp; diſſolue theſe, which are to be expelled by rolling: for a great deale of water doth more digeſt than attract.</p>
               <p>Surely it is euident, that in that ligature which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the endes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rolles are leſſe to be coarcted, but wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we muſt nouriſh, there the endes muſt be ſtraiter, and the other inuoluings more loſe.</p>
               <p>Now ſéeing we haue founde out not onely what time we muſt helpe the generation of <hi>Callus,</hi> but alſo by what maner, now there reſteth, to ſet out the vniuerſall order of diet. For in the beginning, they ought to vſe moſt thinne dyet, as we will proue when we take in hand the proper curation of inflammations. Furthermore, we will declare that ſometime it ſhalbe expedient to let bloud, and alſo to purge, but what time <hi>Callus</hi> is ingendred, the bodie is to be nouriſhed with good iuyſe, which may much nouriſh, of which there accuſtometh to follow, not onely good iuiſe, but that which is alſo tough, of which principally <hi>Callus</hi> is made: for ſéeing that it cannot grow of a ſerous and thin moiſture, &amp; that it can ſpedely grow, of that which is groſe and brickle, and voide of fatneſſe, but yet in time waxeth drye, it is made friable, and apt to breake.</p>
               <p>The bigneſſe of <hi>Callus,</hi> ſhalbe ſuch, as it were a ſafe band to the bones, &amp; yet not compreſſe the muſcles, for that <hi>Callus</hi> which is to little, is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the bones, &amp; that which is to great, bringeth dolor to the muſcles: ſo that diligent
<pb facs="tcp:18258:127"/> hede muſt be had to encreaſe it, if it groweth to little, and to let it if that it doth increſe to much. And thou ſhalt doe theſe both by the quantitie of the perfuſion, and alſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and quantitie of meates, and alſo the faculties of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which are to it outwardly applyed, but we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of perfuſion and order of dyet of medicines, and ſuch as haue an emplaſtike ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; do moderately heat, they doe both bring forth <hi>Callus,</hi> and alſo increaſeth them. But ſuch medicines as haue a digeſtiue facultie, doe demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe <hi>Callus</hi> which are now great, but if thou ſtudieſt that neither <hi>Callus</hi> ſhalbe encreaſed, or deminiſhed, but art content to let it grow further, vſe thou ſome of thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which are applyed to gréene wounds, which becauſe they doe moderately drye, they cauſe <hi>Callus</hi> moderately to coagulate and grow: and this is ſufficient touching ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart fractures.</p>
               <p>Now of thoſe that are in length, the cure is in all points as the other, but yet the ligature muſt be ſtraiter made in the fractured place, and that which is a ſunder, muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly thruſt to thoſe which are diuerſely fractured, and chiefely with a wound, as it doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly happen to theſe. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> willeth that ſplents bowed like a ſawe, and dipped in redde and auſter wine, chiefely in ſommer be put about it. For if any doth vſe either Oyle, or Serot, they doe putrifie, becauſe the affect being goeater than the reſt, doe more drye than they require to be dryed. And let all the medicines as he commaundeth be drying, but yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the meane of excication, he willeth ſuch medicines to be of the kinde of <hi>Enema.</hi> But if any ſhall at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vſe an <hi>Enemon</hi> medicine, let it be ſuch a one as is apt to be poured in, and all other thinges are to be done after his precepte, not onely in theſe rehearſed, but alſo if the bare bone requireth to be cut with a ſaw, or that thou ſhalt take away ſome fragment, or that it behoueth to miniſter to nature expelling it, what ſo euer <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> doubted of thoſe inſtruments which the legges are to be layde in, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Solenas,</hi> whether they are to be vſed or not, all men doe know that I iudge the reaſons laudable, and <hi>Gloſconum,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:18258:127"/> which is inuented of the later Phiſitions, we doe account it as worthie of praiſe as anie other, &amp; doe vſe it, when, in the time of engendering fleſh. Yet it ſéemeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Furthermore the armes with the bands being put about, &amp; as it were bowed, the extention which is made fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the higher parts to the lower, ought to be done by the pulley or vice, which are placed in the ſides of <hi>Glottocomon,</hi> thou maiſt call this inſtrument <hi>Solena,</hi> with his adiection, <hi>Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Machanicum,</hi> or <hi>Glottocomon Mechanicum,</hi> but we ſhal more largelie ſpeake of inſtruments, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſet out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cure of luxations, where alſo we will no leſſe ſpeake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ligatures which are to be put about.

Trulie for that in theſe Commentaries we haue added more than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he hath ſpoken, and defined that he left vndefined. It behoueth that we ſpeake firſt of the hollow cutting inſtruments, called <hi>Gneliſcus,</hi> next of <hi>Phacotus,</hi> after of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> narow cutting kniues, and laſt that we intreate of the vſe of medicines, therefore there are ſome fractures of <hi>Cranium,</hi> which commeth to the ſecond table called <hi>Diploen,</hi> ſome to the inward part of the bones, ſome are ſimple fractures, ſome are contuſions, and ſome the marks of thoſe wherwith the ſtripe was made, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine the ſimple fractures, which come to the ſecond table, thoſe néede the narow kniues before ſpoken of. It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite both to haue many of them, &amp; alſo differing in bigneſſe, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhould want which is moſt apt for the purpoſe, and the bone affected being made bare, as the manner is, you ſhall firſt vſe the broadeſt knife, next another which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, &amp; ſo the reſt orderlie, vntill you come to the narow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and this is to be vſed in the ſecond tables. Afterward both theſe, &amp; ſo to the end it muſt be cured with drying me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which for that cauſe are called <hi>Cephalica,</hi> &amp; thoſe are made of <hi>Iris illiriaca,</hi> and meale of <hi>Eruum,</hi> and <hi>Manna,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> and the rinde of the roote of <hi>Panax,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, all ſuch medicines as mundifie without corroſion, for the generation of fleſh is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke of nature it ſelfe, &amp; there the patient in that behalfe hath no néed of the art of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, &amp; that the fleſh which doth engender may cloſe, &amp; cleue about to euerie part of the bone, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhall chieflie followe, if there be no filthineſſe vpon it, neither yet anie oyle or fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, therefore this one thing which the Phiſitions helpe to the production of fleſh in the hurt patients, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all the place

But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is done with Teribles, is dangerous, becauſe while they more boldlie vſe it, they doe often hurt <hi>Dura mater,</hi> which is the next bone. Alſo that which is done by <hi>Cicliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos</hi> is not without fault, when that it doth immoderatlie ſhake that which requireth reſt. Therfore it liketh me beſt, if the fractures be great, &amp; the bones fractured vehemently, to vſe <hi>Cicliſcos,</hi> for with ſmall inciſion thou maieſt make ſpace with lenticuler Exciſcories, &amp; if the bones be ſure and firme, they muſt be pearced through with a Terible.

Trulie it is conuenient to haue many ſuch Teribles ſeruing to the thickneſſe of euerie <hi>Cranium,</hi> for to a thicker <hi>Cranium</hi> a longer Terible is conuenient, I do cal it ſo, whoſe ſpace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point of the Terible, &amp; the circle extant compaſſing it, is longer, &amp; to a thinner <hi>Cranium,</hi> a ſhorter Terible: &amp; this alſo is that which hath a leſſe ſpace betwixt the point &amp; the ring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goeth out. And trulie whether I ſhal call theſe more dangerous or ſurer than the other, but they vſe thoſe that are called <hi>Choenicidas,</hi> but vſe thou with good ſucceſſe <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliſcos,</hi> if thou bée not ſkilfull of thoſe things which maye deceiue thée, neither yet more fearefull than needeth, firſt thoſe that are broader, then thoſe which are narrower, vntill thou come to <hi>Dura mater.</hi> But that bone which muſt bée cut out, is not to bée made bare round about with the <hi>Cicliſce,</hi> but on that part chieflie where the frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is moſt grieuous, for beſides other, the pannicle it ſelfe doeth moſt ſpéedelie ſeparate from the bones that are
<pb facs="tcp:18258:129"/> vehementlie affected, ſo that there is no feare of touching y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is alreadie ſeparated, for if thou haſt once made one part bare, &amp; ſetteſt thy knife, which hath in the end a blunt and light forme of a lentle, which is like a peaſe, and the edge erected in length, when as you haue ſet the broade part of the lentle vpon the pannicle, ſtrike it with a mallet, &amp; ſo then thou ſhalt diuide <hi>Cranium,</hi> for doing thus, all things come to paſſe as we would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for one cannot wound the pannicle, yea, though he did it ſlipping, touching it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with the broade part of the lentle, which if it doth anie where cleaue to <hi>Cranium,</hi> the roundneſſe of the lentle doth without daunger take that awaie, for the inſtrument it ſelfe called Lentle, cutting <hi>Cranium</hi> followeth at his back, it going before, ſo that thou ſhalt not finde out another waie of pearcing, which ſhall bee leſſe daunger, or yet more ſpéedie.

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:18258:129"/>
               <p>Now I will héereafter ſhew how much of that is to bée cut awaie that is affected, that which is vehementlie frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, is to be all taken awaie, and if certaine fragments come out further from it, as ſometime it is ſéene to happen, it is not expedient to follow theſe to the end, being aſſured that hurt or damage ſhall follow to them that haue it, if all other thinges be rightlie done, wée doing ſo not once or twice, but often haue had our deſire. And the Indication of doing things, is héere alſo taken of the nature of the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted partes, for the ligature which in other fractures reaſon hath found out, to kéepe backe inflammations, thou canſt not vſe to the head. Therfore thou canſt not ſtaie that which floweth, neither expulſe out of the affected partes that is in them contained, without which remedies, none of the other bones can bée conſerued ſound. For imagine that in the arme, the bone is broken vnto the marowe, and that none afterward doe vind it as it becommeth a Fracture, it muſt follow neceſſarilie, that not onelie the matter which is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered outwardlie vnder the ſkinne and muſcles, but alſo which is in the marow, doth both firſt and principallie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the marrowes it ſelfe, &amp; alſo with it the whole bone. Séeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when all things are rightlie done, this doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time chance. How then may not ſuch things happen to the head, ſéeing that it cannot haue the ligature which is due to Fractures, and alſo the matter ſinketh downe in ſuch ſort, as all lieth vpon the coate or pannicle in other Fractures, when it is well rolled, it is ſo farre, that it ſuffereth no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſture to be gathered in the affected bone, that it maketh the member leaner than for his naturall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The waie that is excogitated by ligature, cannot both ſo exact the fractured bone &amp; the parts about it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhall neither be inflamed, or yéeld anie mattier, neither is there anie medicine, which in other partes can without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, as we haue ſaid, kéepe the fractured bone drie, &amp; frée from ſuperfluities. Wherefore we had néede firſt to make bare ſome part of the Fracture, wherby we may mundifie &amp; wipe awaie the Sanies from the coate, and when the time of inflammation is paſt, and all is exactlie drie, then to

But when I did marke both the thickneſſe and the hardneſſe of the bone, I did iudge it better to take out the bone, than for regard of the fluxe to finite vehemently the braine, and I alſo thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might happen, that if there were a great hole in the ſide, that the braine might perchance come to this part. Further, there, &amp; that not in one place is in the ſides a ſpringing of nerues, and that of no ſmall quantitie, when as in the high bones of the head there neuer ſpringeth the leaſt nerue of all, and I being by theſe things warned, did abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking out the bone that was in the ſide of the head, and it euer had <hi>Callus,</hi> and if it were rightlie cured, and now trulie there reſteth, that wée ſéeke out what is our principall ſcope of all, both medicines, and eke of all our diligence, when as the bone is perforated, whether that which is moſt delicate, and anſwerable to the pleaſure of the Patient, which now the moſt part vſe, or elſe that which is héereto repugnant, that is, that which is done by moſt vehement exiccatiue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,

Notwithſtanding I can thus much witnes with <hi>Eudemus,</hi> for that was the olde mans name, they rather eſcaped which were of him cured, than of thoſe who vſed delicate medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and I had alſo gone about to trie the like waie of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, if I had continuallie remained in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but ſéeing I haue bidde at <hi>Rome,</hi> I doe followe the manner of the Citie, committing the greateſt part of ſuch workes to thoſe whom they call Chirurgions. But iudging the nature of the things it ſelfe, I conceiue that ſuch certaine determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be confirmed by our experience. The auditorie cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit which ſtretcheth not onelie vnto <hi>Dura mater,</hi> but alſo toucheth the nerue which goeth from it to the braine, this although it be ſo néere, doth abide, as it is ſaid, moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment medicines. Therefore it is no meruaile, if after the perforation of <hi>Cranium, Dura mater,</hi> before it is much moleſted with inflammation, doth deſire moſt ſtrong medicines, hauing naturallie as it were a drie ſubſtance.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Grecians vſe to call that an inflmma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which commeth with great tumor or ſwelling in the fleſhie parte, ſtrained and ſtretched forth, reſiſting with pulſation &amp; dolour, hot and red. The cauſe of theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, is not onelie vnknowen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the common ſort, but alſo vnto manie Phiſitions, (or as we terme them, thoſe that vſeth the art of Medicine) for diuerſe of them, not ſéeking out diligentlie, doe ſimplie pronounce that which ſéemeth good vnto themſelues, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the thing. But conſideration muſt be had héerein, if you will procéede in this mattier. Therfore there is neuer anie great tumour that chaunceth in anie parte of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die againſt nature, except the ſame parte be affected with one of theſe two thinges: For either it is made flowing, increaſed, and ſtretched forth through ouer much hotneſſe, either elſe it taketh ſome new ſubſtance outwardlie. And when this fluxe doth happen, &amp; is ſtretched out with ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it is tourned into ſpirites, and béeing refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it doeth eaſilie tourne againe into his accuſtomed ſwelling.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18258:133"/>
                  <p>But we ſée no ſpirits in the inflamed parte, neither yet the part inflamed being refrigerated, doe not alwaies come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into their former conſtitution. And it is manifeſt by inciſion alſo, that there is no ſpirites therein contained, for if the inflamed part be cutte, much bloud will runne out, and all the place ſéemeth euidentlie full of bloud, like vnto a wet Spunge: But yet you ſhal ſée no ſpirits come forth, either preſentlie or yet long after, and the coulour of bloud is altogether inſeparable. There is no part of the bodie that is red, but bloud and fleſh, neither is the multitude of fleſh the affect of inflammation, for although the multitude of fleſh be in the bodie without multitude of bloud, yet the tumour trulie ſhall be bigger than natural, and the coulour ſhall be healthfull, and not ſwarue from his accuſtomed nature: for in anie thing which naturallie increaſeth, the coulour is not augmented, for then ſhould Snow be made more white, Pitch more blacke, and Golde more yeolowe. And the increaſing of ſubſtance differeth manifeſtlie from alteration, for thinges increaſe according to their quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and altereth according to their qualities, but coulour ſheweth the qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubſtance, and not the quantitie: Therefore the multitude of fleſh differeth from an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and for that cauſe, the bodies which abound with bloud, bée moſt troubled with inflammations. Now, ſéeing that ſometime in wounds there be greate inflammations, and yet there floweth forth thin and watrie humours, the place it ſelfe round about it appearing red, it is therefore héerein, that the thickneſſe of the fleſh or member wherein the wound is, to be of a mediocritie, and not vnnaturallie ſwelled, that it may ſuffer the mattier more eaſilie to come forth, and that it may the more eaſilie containe the bloud, which is neceſſarie for the nouriſhment héereof: But you ſhall vnderſtand, that mattier or Sanies, how much it is more thin than bloud, ſo much it is groſer than ſpirites. Wherfore if the wounded fleſh doth permit mattier to flow out, it muſt of neceſſite ſuffer ſpirits to paſſe forth alſo. And ſo theſe ſpirits being euacuated, the tumor and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ceaſe, for trulie it ſo happeneth often times, in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18258:133"/> thoſe parts, whereas ſpirits are aggreuated, the parte once cut, all the tumor vaniſheth.</p>
                  <p>The generation alſo of inflammations in wounds, is a witneſſe thereof, for in the beginning, when woundes are new, there floweth multitude of bloud, which being ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with things refrigeratiue, or elſe the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber it ſelf bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refrigerated, it is ſtaied. It is alſo ſtaied by compreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our hands, or with ligatures, the bloud being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iealed in the edge of the cut part, and ſo retained, doth waxe thicke as it were a clod, or as we may tearme it, a coniea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thing, for they onelie differ in this, that the clod or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iealed bloud ſhuld be a ſenſible concreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bloud, gathered together in the wounds ſtaied in the ſmall paſſages of the cut partes, making the bloud groſe. And when the bloud is groſe, and the ſides of the cut part more ſtraight, the bloud is retained, and the ſanies put forth. All theſe be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt coniectures, that the inflamed part abound with bloud, and that the heate ſhould be more than natural, but yet not ſo hot, that with heate onelie without flowing and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſhould make ſuch a tumour, for heereof are manie conſiderations to be had, for then in burning Agues, howe much the heate were more vehement, ſo much the greater ſhould the tumor be in the inflamed part. The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture is taken of the ſubſtaunce of the bloud, for it is not coniealed of colde, as Pitch, Roſen, and Waxe is, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies by nature more hotte. For thoſe when as they are made hot, they turne to the contrarie, and become thin, but bloud by nature being hot, the tumour may well be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what greater, but yet not ſo much, by the reaſon of onelie heate, to raiſe vp anie great quantitie in the inflamed part, but Pitch, Roſen, and Waxe, comming to ſo much extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of heate as doth the inflamed partes, they are made ſome thing bigger, and theſe things being conſidered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that which we haue ſpoken, is no ſmall coniecture, that the tumour of the inflamed parte, commeth not onelie of fluxe, for there is no ſmall alteration in the heate of the bloud, which cauſeth the tumour to be bigger. And let that which appeareth to be, to the an apt coniecture.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18258:134"/>
                  <p>For in blond there is not as in pitch, roſin, and war, being vehemently made hot great confuſion, but it kéepeth, being boyled on the fire, his accuſtomed tumor, or is very little increaſed. And I haue declared aboue, that inflammations, being refrigerated, the tumor did not alwayes ſeaſe, for a vehement and great inflammation, in which there is a flux impacted, although you doe vehemently refrigerate it, yet you doe not ſeade the tumor, but make the part of a leadie coulour, and turneth the affect into <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> by the reaſon of the cold medicine. And ſome inflammation as we haue ſayde before which hath a flux ioyned with it, may eaſely be cured, with things which doe refrigerate, and be aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, &amp; chiefely, when it is little. But the flux, being firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted, (or as we may terme it confirmed) then neither aſtringent, nor colde things helpeth, for it doth require the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euacuation. Therefore, the auncient Phiſitions, inuented medicines, not onely to diſcus, diſſolue, &amp; driue away with their hotneſſe, but alſo did inuent to ſcarifie the ſkinne, and ſo to euacuate the bloud ſenſibly.</p>
                  <p>All theſe are great tokens, that the inflamed parts, are full of bloud, and yet this inflammation, is not preſently at the beginning, but by proſes of time, the powers being ſtopped, and perſpiration laſted, this is brought to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore of neceſſitie, the bloud ſo remaining, it doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie, for all things hot and moiſt, gethered in hot &amp; moiſt places, doth redely putrifie, if they be not ſpedely, euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either elſe refrigerated. Wherefore, if the heate, which commeth of putrifaction, ſurmounteth that which it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that is eaſely knowne, by the inflamation of the part, and the bloud gathered vnto the tumor. Notwithſtanding, although the veines, which for their littleneſſe, did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the beginning: yet then they will appeare. Theſe commeth not onely of inflammation, but alſo becauſe they are filled with bloud.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they come to that bigneſſe, that they may be moſt manifeſtly perceued, and that chiefely in the eyes, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie members, and womens breſts, and that the fleſhe, who being inflamed, ſéemeth to abound with bloud, both the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18258:134"/> and the tumor doth declare the ſame. Wherefore all the fleſhe is compared like vnto woolle, or a wet ſpunge, which you may more perfectly vnderſtand, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier commeth forth, for then the inflamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing paſſage, the truth is perceued.</p>
                  <p>And I truely ſuppoſe, the ſkinne to be diſtended, and lifted vp, with thoſe humors that are gathered to gether in the tumor, and in time, the tunicles and veſſells, which be vnderneth, taketh ſome part of the flux, like as the vpper ſkinne doth, which couereth the inflamed part. Yea, alſo the nerues, and tendons, by profes of time are inflamed, and ſome time the diſeaſe commeth of theſe, as they chaunce to be wounded. But yet vniuerſally, there is nothing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature, in the inflamed parte, when as it hath long remained ſo, for the fleſh, with all the reſt, is infected with the flux, in ſo much, as ſome times it commeth to the bones. And ſome time, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame affect it ſelfe ſpringeth of the bone, but the matter being auoided, the ſkinne is made looſer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which was betwéene, is runne foorth, as we haue ſayde in the adminiſtration of the Anathomie, and chiefely, where we haue made diuiſions, or declaration of the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But where there be inflamations, all theſe parts are filled with bloud, flowing out of the veſſells, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed into euery part of the fleſh, as it were a dewe.</p>

Therefore, where as there is any manifeſt hole, as it were a conduct, prepared for the excrementes to be purged, this place being open, part runneth out, by pus or matter, and part doth breth out ſenſibly.

                  <p>The auncient Phiſitions doe commonlie call all theſe by the names of Apoſtumes, and principallie theſe which be in the profound and déepe partes.

But this Apoſtume ſhall not be ſo grieuous, by a great deale, as the firſt was, for ſo much as the partes which were diuided, are not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together againe, and that the humour doeth quicklie and ſpéedelie fill the ſame, inſomuch, that <hi>Sinus</hi> (as we may tearme it) doth eaſilie receiue the fluxe againe, and as it doth quicklie receiue it, ſo doth it ſpéedelie euacuate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, hauing an apt waie for the fluxe to auoide at.

                  <p>NOw wée intend to ſpeake of choloricke fluxes, and it hath growen now of cuſtome amongſt the Phiſitions, I know not by what meanes, that whether we name choler ſimply, or cholericke humors, we vnderſtand it to be yelow, pale, and bitter choler, and not ſharpe, and black cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, for they name that with an addition, ioyning the colour of the humor with the name.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, when any cholerike flux, which we do name exact choler, chaunceth to reſt in any place, it doth vlcerate the ſkinne, but when it is mixed with watry humors and bloudie, it is of leſſe ſharpneſſe, and cauſeth the part gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, rather to turne into a tumor, then into an vlcer, and this tumor is called <hi>Eriſipelas,</hi> and that which is vlcerated, is called <hi>Herpis,</hi> theſe are knowne, bothe by their coulour, and by their heate, which ſheweth the humour that they are ingendred of. Againe, according to the ſharpneſſe of the humour, they doe differ, for that which commeth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18258:137"/> of the ſharper humour, is called <hi>Herpes Eſtiominon,</hi> for ſo doth <hi>Hippocrates</hi> name it. But of the other which is leſſe ſharpe commeth <hi>Herpes milaris,</hi> which many haue called ſo after <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> becauſe it maketh riſings in the ſkinne like vnto the ſéedes of Milium.

And where bloud and choler is equallie mixed together, the forme and nature of it is in a meane betwixt Eriſipelas and inflammation. But if either hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour excéede in quantitite, the diſeaſe taketh his name of that which doth abound, as they call that where choler doeth ſurmount bloud, <hi>Eriſipelas inflamatorie,</hi> and where bloud ſurmounteth, they call it <hi>Inflamatio Eriſipelatas.</hi> The like interpretation is alſo vſed in the mixing together of other humours, as <hi>Inflamatio Sirroidis,</hi> and <hi>Sirrhus inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori,</hi> and <hi>Oedema inflamatori,</hi> and <hi>Inflamatio Oedematoſa.</hi> Theſe foure are they which oftentimes are made affects, and chaunceth through the fluxe of humours, I doe meane Phlegmon, Eriſipelas, <hi>Oedema,</hi> and Sirrhus.

            <p>But we will intreate of theſe foure faculties as moſt principall héereafter more at large.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Attractrix.</hi> The drawer of conuenient qualitie and iuyce into euerie parte to nouriſh the ſame (the which is common vnto all partes that drawe vnto them ſuch nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as is moſt proper for them, ſometime thorough ſtraight pores, as in the ſtomacke, and ſometime onelie by the temperature of the parte, as almoſt in all the other partes, or elſe to the voluptuous delectation of the parte, whereby the mouth of the matrixe doth drawe the ſéede of man to the verie end, and whereby the gall doth ſeparate and drawe yeolow choler from the liuer, but in the Gall, yeolow choler is not ingendered, as <hi>Aſclapiades</hi> ſaith, like as neither, he affirmeth melancholik humour in the ſplene, but of him it is drawen from the liuer to nouriſh it ſelfe. The reines doe diuide and onelie drawe the vrine out of a hollow veine from the bloud, and it is not carried of his owne accorde into the reines, as though that were the beſt.</p>
            <p>Neither doe the hollow veines drawe together and wind about, thruſt forth the vrine into the oblique reines, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe, which lie right vnderneath in the ſides, to be ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out with all the bloud, and becauſe it is thinner than bloud, to be tranſmitted: euen as all the Wine runneth into the veſſell of the Wine preſſe, and as the coniealed milke is ſtrained, the Whey alone runneth, and not the chéeſe: in like manner the reines doe expell the vrine into the bladder, through <hi>Vreteras,</hi> which are growing on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſides of the bladder, and the humour which is receiued, <hi>Aſclapia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> ſaith, is reſolued into vapours into the bladder, and into the bodie, hauing as it were two tunicles in it, the vapors are let paſſe by waies, vncertaine, darke, ſtraight, &amp; ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:18258:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> can by no ſenſe be perceiued. And they being once againe growen together, do receiue their firſt forme, and ſo out of vapours, humours are engendered, for ſo he hath depriued the reines and <hi>Vreteras</hi> of their function. Neither doe the part of bloud receiue pure bloud aboue the reines, but thoſe things which are beneath, doe receiue the bloud from the reines, (vnto whom they bring faſtned, through preſſing wil as <hi>Serum</hi> be carried) being purged and diſtilled, as certaine of the ſcollers of <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> ſaie: for if <hi>Serum</hi> were heauie, neither ſhould it be carried of the ſtomacke into the liuer, to be diſtributed, neither into the reines by <hi>Caua,</hi> neyther doth a watrie humour runne into the reines, and a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine humour by <hi>Caua</hi> backward, like vnto oyle and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mingled, which when they are poured on the ground, each run contrarie waie, as other Eraſiſtratians affirme. Nor yet as <hi>Licius</hi> ſaith, the vrine is the nouriſhment of the reines. Therefore the reines doe drawe the vrine, for that it is familiar and pleaſant vnto them, and not by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is made emptie. For ſo when no more vrine did abound, then was it made emptie by <hi>Iſchuria,</hi> that is to ſaie, through ſuppreſſion of the vrine in the reines, blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or other paſſage belonging vnto vrine, as wée haue ſaid before more largelie. In the Tractice of the ſtomacke and the throate, by their ſtraight paſſages, there is no <hi>Degluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> by contraction, as <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> ſaith. In the Tractrice of the liuer, there is a diſtribution of <hi>Chylum,</hi> out of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke and entrailes, into the liuer, by the veines <hi>Meſerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> In the <hi>Tratrice</hi> of all the partes, there is diſtrubution of bloud out of the liuer and <hi>Caua,</hi> into all partes by the braunches of the veine. And not as <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> affirmeth, by the expreſſion of the ſtomacke (for this although it were, ſo yet by reaſon of the length of time, it ſhould haue ſmall power, for the diſtribution of bloud through the veines) not by the veines contraict about the bloud, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, not with that ſucceſſion vnto that parte of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is made vacant, and diſpearſed from our heat, the which thing thoſe that recouer from ſickneſſe doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, who if they haue not more nouriſhment flowing and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18258:143"/> abounding in them, then there is place vacant, they ſhall neuer recouer their accuſtomed helth, &amp; moreouer, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloud in the bodie, could neuer be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the liuer. In the tracture of purging medicines it may appeare, they drawe proper qualities, or certaine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, familiar vnto them, out of our bodies, as <hi>Scamoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> draweth yeolowe choler out of one that hath the Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Elleborus niger</hi> draweth blacke choler <hi>ex Melancolico, Cnicus, Coccum, &amp; Gnidium,</hi> draweth fleame <hi>ex Leuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmatico: flos aeris, Squamma aeris, aes Vſtum, Chamedris, Chamelion,</hi> draweth a thin and watrie excrement <hi>ex Aſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico,</hi> and theſe tumors are not engendered in vs of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines themſelues, making our bodies ſupple, as <hi>Aſclepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> doth falſelie ſurmiſe, denying the facultie attractiue vnto euerie conuenient qualitie, whereby <hi>Magnes</hi> draweth yron, <hi>Succinum</hi> a little moate, and corne the water layde vnderneath it in earthen veſſells, and certaine medicines doe pull out ſplints and arrowe heads faſtned verie déepe in the fleſh, and alſo poiſon of Serpents, which was put in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe certaine medicines drawe the poiſon of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſome the poiſon of <hi>Paſtinaca marina,</hi> &amp; other of others, inſomuch that the poiſon drawen out, hath ben found lying vpon the medicine. By the which ſimilitude, the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may drawe thinges, other medicines drawe not by hooke and crooke <hi>Attomos,</hi> ioyning together, as they mette one another with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> the which he and <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> did appoint to be the firſt elements of all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Retentrix.</hi> The reteiner of proper qualities drawen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerie parte, vntill digeſtion be perfect, when there is nouriſhment, but if there be excrements which doe trouble the part wherein it lieth, as in the entrailes, the bladders, &amp;c. ſwelling with quantitie, or ſharpe and biting qualitie, or in both together. The childe is reteined in the wombe, vntill that through greatneſſe, weight, biting, or that the infant be auoide with ſweate, or vrine, the <hi>Membranae</hi> bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, or through ſome other vrgent cauſe, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to be deliuered.

<pb facs="tcp:18258:144"/> all parts which are to be nouriſhed, but it appeareth moſt plainlie in thoſe parts which are greatlie hollow, as in the ſtomacke, womb, bladder, and is moſt delighted in theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique paſſages, but in other partes it is more obſcure, it is alſo placed in the temperature of thoſe partes, euen as all the reſt are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coctrix.</hi> The digeſter of the ſubſtaunce reteined in the part, the which ſubſtance is ſo much the rather made like vnto the parte by alteration, as it is more néerer, &amp; of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſimilitude, to the ſame in qualities, as of bloud, fleſh is ſoone made, but that ſubſtance which hath leſſe ſimilitude with the part, it is neceſſarie that it be chaunged flower, &amp; firſt by all the meane qualities, as of bloud, hot, moiſt, and red, ther cannot at the firſt daſh be made a bone, colde, hard, and white: but there muſt néeds be many alterations and chaunges, in the middle. And for that cauſe there are two kindes of inſtruments pertaining to nutrition. The one is that which draweth, carrieth, conteineth, and digeſteth the nouriſhment, and as it were a ſtraunge burthen, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and beareth it, ſuch are firſt, <hi>Cocturae, Os, Gula, Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus, Inteſtina,</hi> ſecond, <hi>Meſaraice, Venae, Hepar, Caua vena,</hi> thirdlie, all the parts <hi>Similares,</hi> and of theſe, <hi>Organice,</hi> and <hi>Vene capillares,</hi> the which as the chiefeſt prepare by altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the nouriſhment méete for euerie part. The other is, that which by drawing the excrement of nouriſhment, doth diuide, carrie, reteine, and purge it, as are <hi>Lien, Rene, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bae Veſicae,</hi> with the paſſages of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomack, chiefly by <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa inteſtina, Spincteres ambo, Muſculi octo epigaſtrij.</hi> And thoſe muſcles which doe make the reſtraint of the breath, and alſo thoſe which is verie profitable and neceſſarie for the ſiege, and vrine, and vnto the bearing of a childe. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough this nouriſhing alteration, when as the partes are made, that which remaineth is like vnto them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>Aſsimulatio,</hi> but through the ingendering alteration, thoſe partes which before were not, are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards created.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Expultrix,</hi> the expeller of thoſe things which could not bée ouercome, digeſted, or perfectlie altered, and that could
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18258:144"/> not be made like vnto that which ought to be nouriſhed, when they are gréeued, as it were with a ſtrange burden, the part which demaunded them, either by concoction or attraction, and when they ſtretching out in quantitie, or troubling with ſharpe qualitie, or both, doe greatly hurt it. This facultie, is excedingly delited with croked wayes, which are theſe parts, the ſtomacke, entrailes, wombe, both the bladders, veines, and arteries. Expulſion, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto attraction, is often times through one paſſage, as vomite and ſwallowing downe through the throte: the ſéede and the encreaſe, through the neck of the priuie parts. The diſtribution of nutriment, &amp; the attraction of purging medicines, &amp; voluntarie expultion of the iuice, abounding in vs, through <hi>Meſaraicas venas.</hi> Theſe nouriſhing faculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are vnderſtanded by the name of naturall things, for that from the conception of the ſéede, euen vnto death, they are in a liuing creature, and alſo in a plant, for they help ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, &amp; action, &amp; one likewiſe furthereth an other, that by nutrition, there may be a certaine particuler generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and corruption, wherefore theſe thrée bookes entreat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt onely of theſe faculties, vnto whome, <hi>corruptio, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutio,</hi> &amp; <hi>atrophia,</hi> are contrary. Theſe faculties with certain inſtruments, which haue action, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vnto all the bodie, are of two ſorts, that is, generall, and perticuler. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall are either all preſent, as in the ſtomack and liuer, or elſe thrée of them onely, as in the two bladders, for one of them digeſt, or two of them alone, as in the reines, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they digeſt, nor reteine, or at the leaſt very little, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they want great capacitie, or elſe the facultie <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultrix,</hi> as the entrailes, which haue for that cauſe onely cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked paſſages in their tunikes. And foraſmuch as theſe ought to be nouriſhed, as wel as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſimiler parts. They haue foure particuler faculties, nouriſhers of them, placed in the temperature of their ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Hetherto wée haue declared, which are the naturall actions, how they be made, and of what parts.</p>
